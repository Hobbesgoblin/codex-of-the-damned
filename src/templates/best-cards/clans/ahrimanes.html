<h1><img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/icons/clan-ahrimanes.svg') }}"> Ahrimanes</h1>
<p>
    Ahrimanes and their unique discipline <i>z</i> provide a stronger defence than the usual <i>i</i>
    builds.
    Moreover, the acces to <i>r</i> allow them more toolboxy constructs than mono <i>i</i>, for a little
    more
    bleed. They offer basically two possible crypts, a group 2 with
    {{ card("Howler") }} and
    {{ card("The Siamese") }}, and a group 4 with
    {{ card("Muricia") }} and
    {{ card("Effie Lowery") }}.
</p>
<p>
    This clan has only one main archetype: {{ link("/archetypes/cats", _("Cats")) }}.
    Some Ahrimaines are good picks for mono <i>i</i> archetypes as they offer <i>I</i> vampires
    for good value like {{ card("Effie Lowery") }} and
    {{ card("Sahana") }}.
</p>

        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 36 decks, typically 1-3 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Superior <i>I</i> and <i>Z</i> at a very decent cost of 5, she is even included in pure <i>I</i>
        crypts.

        <h4>Muricia</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 23 decks, typically 2-4 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Leader of the group 4 crypt, she has all clan disciplines <i>ZIR</i> at superior
        for a reasonnable cost of 7. The +1 strength bonus is always good to take: she can use a little less
        {{ card("Aid From Bats") }} for a little more
        {{ card("Carrion Crows") }}.

        <h4>Howler</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 17 decks, typically 4-5 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Leader of the group 2 crypt, she has all clan disciplines <i>ZIR</i> at superior
        for a cost of 8. The maneuver combined with the +1 strength bonus makes her a good warrior on her
        own.

        <h4>Nose of the Hound</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 41 decks, typically 1-4 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A nice rush action, slightly better than <span class="card" onclick="dC('bumsrush')">Bum's
            Rush</span>.
        It is often played in <i>a</i> constructs for its base effect, as <i>i</i> provides the
        arguably better {{ card("Deep Song") }} already.

        <h4>Speak with Spirits</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 36 decks, typically 6-11 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        An excellent unlock and intercept reaction, the core of most Ahrimanes defensive modules.
        An unlock is better than a simple wake, and the card is cheap: it costs blood only if
        both unlock and intercept are needed.

        <h4>Swiftness of the Stag</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 35 decks, typically 5-9 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A versatile tool: it is decisive in combat and works well with the <i>i</i> classic combination of
        {{ card("Aid From Bats") }} and
        {{ card("Carrion Crows") }}. Moreover, the optional
        +1 stealth is very useful to get critical actions through.
        It is a straight upgrade over the similar
        {{ card("Resist Earth's Grasp") }}.

        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='img/card-images/falconseye.jpg') }}">
        <h4>Falcon's Eye</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 34 decks, typically 2-5 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        The only card apart <i>a</i> {{ card("Eagle's Sight") }} and
        {{ card("Anneke") }} to allow
        cross-table blocks, it is a drastic improvement over the classical <i>i</i> intercept module.
        The ability to intercept one's prey bleed or a cross-table vote is critical to
        {{ link("/strategy/archetypes", _("wall decks"), _anchor="wall") }}.

        <h4>Ears of the Hare</h4>
        <p class="center-subtitle">played in 28 decks, typically 2-4 copies</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A strong intercept boost on par with <i>a</i>
        {{ card("Enhanced Senses") }},
        this completes the <i>z</i> toolset for intercept. Combined with
        {{ card("Falcon's Eye") }} and
        {{ card("Speak with Spirits") }}, along <i>i</i>
        {{ card("Cat's Guidance") }},
        it delivers an intercept module as solid as <i>a</i>.
