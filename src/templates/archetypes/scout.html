<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>Vote</em> deck using {{ card("Scout Youngwood") }}
    for her <i>MORf</i> disciplines and unique access to
    {{ card("Shattering Crescendo") }},
    {{ card("Lily Prelude") }} and
    {{ card("Reckless Agitation") }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Villein") }} and
    {{ card("Zillah's Valley") }} are used to get more vampires
    out fast and cheap.
<p>
    The deck has serious stealth, with most vampires having <i>O</i>, and plays
    {{ card("Heart of the City") }} to enhance the bleed
    in the late game.
</p>
<p>
    As all vampires except {{ card("Scout Youngwood") }} are
    <em>Princes</em> and <em>Justicars</em>,
    {{ card("Parity Shift") }}
    is heavily used both for pool damages and bloat.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Dmitra Ilyanova") }}'s ability is a great way
    to get more blood on the table for those {{ card("Villein") }} and
    {{ card("Reckless Agitation") }}.
</p>
<p>
    With only 5 votes amoung its two star vampires, the deck can struggle to get the vote lock against
    other political constructs. Hence the inclusion of
    {{ card("Legendary Vampire") }},
    {{ card("Bewitching Oration") }} and
    {{ card("Perfect Paragon") }} to get critical votes through.
    If the pool allows it and she is drawn, getting
    {{ card("Arishat") }} out is a good way to handle an Inner Circle, too.
</p>
<p>
    Combat is purely defensive and uses only {{ card("Majesty") }}.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The archetype is seldom played and not many variations exist.
    Using a different crypt around can allow for different plays, for example
    using {{ card("Unmada") }} and
    {{ card("Benjamin Rose") }} for <i>A</i> and the excellent
    {{ card("Telepathic Misdirection") }} bounce.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Djordje Bjelajac's deck"), twda_id="2011ecfcq") }}
    from the 2011 EC FCQ is a good example of that.

I ditched Undele and Ashurs relatively early on as I\nfound them too slow and switched to a more parity shift focused style adding 2\nextra princes (thanks for the tip on Karen Shan). Get lots of minions, keep the\npool lower so you can Zillah's to parity shift, and then Lily Prelude or\nReckless for the knock out.\n\nShatterings didn't really play that much of a part this weekend but they're a\ngreat add on module. The two Heart of the City - thanks Julian - were also a\nbetter bleed module than adding legal manipulations, with those and the\nLegendary Vampires I usually had someone who could bleed for 3 at stealth - a\ngreat plan since 94\n","crypt":{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":4,"id":"200349","name":"Dmitra Ilyanova"},{"comments":null,"count":4,"id":"201253","name":"Scout Youngwood"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"200136","name":"Arishat"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"200533","name":"Graham Gottesman"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"200753","name":"Karen Suadela"}],"count":12},"date":"2017-10-01","event":"Australian Continental Championship 2017","library":{"cards":[{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":6,"id":"102121","name":"Villein"},{"comments":null,"count":6,"id":"102207","name":"Zillah's Valley"},{"comments":null,"count":3,"id":"101091","name":"Legendary Vampire"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"100588","name":"Dreams of the Sphinx"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100444","name":"Creepshow Casino"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100545","name":"Direct Intervention"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100698","name":"Fame"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101238","name":"Monastery of Shadows"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101711","name":"Secure Haven"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100135","name":"The Barrens"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"102180","name":"Wider View"}],"count":24,"type":"Master"},{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":6,"id":"101761","name":"Shattering Crescendo"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"100652","name":"Entrancement"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"100904","name":"Heart of the City"}],"count":10,"type":"Action"},{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":6,"id":"101353","name":"Parity Shift"},{"comments":null,"count":4,"id":"101056","name":"Kine Resources Contested"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"101109","name":"Lily Prelude"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"101567","name":"Reckless Agitation"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"101663","name":"Rumors of Gehenna"}],"count":16,"type":"Political Action"},{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":5,"id":"100788","name":"Freak Drive"},{"comments":null,"count":5,"id":"102131","name":"Voter Captivation"},{"comments":null,"count":4,"id":"100769","name":"Forgotten Labyrinth"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"100157","name":"Bewitching Oration"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"100617","name":"Elder Impersonation"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"100687","name":"Faceless Night"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"101125","name":"Lost in Crowds"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"101387","name":"Perfect Paragon"}],"count":24,"type":"Action Modifier"},{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"101913","name":"Swallowed by the Night"}],"count":2,"type":"Action Modifier/Combat"},{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":4,"id":"101144","name":"Majesty"}],"count":4,"type":"Combat"}],"count":80},"name":"Scout","place":"Melbourne, Australia","player":"Simon Reed","players_count":35,"score":"2GW7+2.5","tournament_format":"3R+F","twda_id":"2017accma"})
