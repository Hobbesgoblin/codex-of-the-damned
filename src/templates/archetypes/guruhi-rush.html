<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>rush</em> deck using the <i>IP</i> disciplines combination.
    {{ card("Nana Buruku") }} is used for additional Master actions,
    playing {{ card("Ashur Tablets") }} for recursion and
    {{ card("Anarch Revolt") }} for additional pool damage.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Nangila Were") }},
    {{ card("Enkidu, The Noah") }} and/or
    {{ card("Black Annis") }} are used to rush the opponents minions
    and take them down with the powerful <i>IP</i> combat module.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Fame") }} and
    {{ card("Dragonbound") }} are used to improve pool damage a bit.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Powerbase: Luanda") }} and
    {{ card("Well-Marked") }} are nice tools for a <em>rush</em> deck.
</p>
<p>
    Just including a bit of <em>wakes</em> and some intercept enhancers like
    {{ card("Cats' Guidance") }} and
    {{ card("Sense the Savage Way") }}
    keeps the other players guessing on wether the deck can block or not.
</p>
<p>
    Getting {{ card("Wider View") }} at some point helps
    rotating the crypt a little bit.
    {{ card("Andre LeRoux") }} is included as a bleed enhancer once
    all the prey's vampires are down.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module includes a lot of cards in single copy as specific counters.
    They're not likely to jam the hand and can be brought back by
    {{ card("Ashur Tablets") }} if need be.
</p>
<p>
    As the game moves along, the deck can use {{ card("Ashur Tablets") }}
    to concentrate the content of the deck on more bleed or more combat cards, depending on what's needed.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The <strong>Laibon</strong> variant does not go Anarch and can get more toolboxy, using <i>R</i> more for
    {{ card("Enchant Kindred") }} and the excellent
    {{ card("Founders of the Ebony Kingdom") }}.
    {{ card("Grooming the Protégé") }}
    also helps getting vampires out faster.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Michael Heyder's deck"), twda_id="2k9nacday2") }}
    from the 2009 NAC is a good example
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Girls</strong> variant does not go Anarch either and simply focuses on more
    {{ card("Ashur Tablets") }}, like
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Jorge Delgado's deck"), twda_id="2014sncms") }} from 2014 Spanish NC.
    {{ card("Carver's Meat Packing and Storage") }}
    and {{ card("Tension in the Ranks") }} can be added
    to help the rush side of things.
