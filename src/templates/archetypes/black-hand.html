<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck using
    {{ card("Reunion Kamut") }} and
    {{ card("Recruitment Exercise") }}
    to get more vampires out fast and cheap.
    Bleed is done using {{ card("Loss") }}, with <i>o</i> modifiers for stealth.
</p>
<p>
    Black Hand Seraphs have acces to the
	{{ link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("A&B"), _anchor="AB") }} enhancers
    {{ card("Tattoo Signal") }} and
    {{ card("Seraph's Second") }}, allowing the same vampire to
    run both bloat and bleed actions in a single turn.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Watchtower: The Wolves Feed") }}
    hits the table at some point to improve bleed power, after an innocuous Gehenna card like
    {{ card("Break the Code") }} has been played.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("The Art of Memory") }} is a versatile
    modifier and provides a bit of recursion. It can be used to get a
    {{ card("Loss") }},
    {{ card("Seraph's Second") }} or
    {{ card("Reunion Kamut") }} back, depending on the hand.
    The second
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Blood Awakening") }} can be used to improve stealth
    or to intercept a key action, depending on the context.
</p>
<p>
    The deck should avoid combat until
    {{ card("Watchtower: The Wolves Feed") }} hits the table,
    as it has nothing else to help combat.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("The Fourth Cycle") }} is used as a last resort safety line
    to avoid dying from
    {{ card("Watchtower: The Wolves Feed") }}
    if too many Gehenna cards hit the table.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The Assamite version as given in example is the most common.
    {{ card("Truth in Ink") }} can be added along some wakes
    for bleed defence and {{ card("No Trace") }} for combat ends.
</p>
<p>
    A common variation uses a mid capacity multi-clan Black Hand crypt with <i>d</i>.
    It looses the <i>o</i> stealth but can be more toolboxy and even include a decent combat module.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Mark Loughman's deck"), twda_id="2018ot2co") }} from 2018 is a recent example.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Elimelech the Twice Damned") }} can be
    the star of a similar construct using <i>A</i> and even <i>E</i> atop <i>o</i>. It looses the access to
    {{ card("Loss") }} but gets bounces with <i>A</i> and can even get
    {{ card("Kindred Spirits") }} if <i>E</i> is present enough
    in the crypt. {{ link("/deck-search", _("Carlo Daniele's deck"), twda_id="2019nbbi") }} from 2019
    is a recent example.
