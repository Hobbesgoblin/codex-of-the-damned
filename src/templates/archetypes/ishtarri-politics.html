{% block archetype %}
<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>political</em> deck using the Ishtarri clan and their <i>RFC</i> disciplines combination.
</p>
<p>
    The deck uses <i>R</i> to bleed with {{ card("Enchant Kindred") }}
    and {{ card("Public Trust") }}.
    Political actions are used to deliver pool damage to the prey with
    {{ card("Kine Resources Contested") }},
    {{ card("Conservative Agitation") }} and
    {{ card("Reins of Power") }}.
</p>
<p>
    Bloat is done by {{ link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("leeching"), _anchor="leeching") }},
    using {{ card("Villein") }} and getting blood
    back on the vampires with {{ card("Voter Captivation") }},
    plus a bit of political actions with
    {{ card("Ancient Influence") }} and
    {{ card("Political Stranglehold") }}.
</p>
<p>
    The deck has a high {{ link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("A&B"), _anchor="AB") }}
	with the <i>F</i> unlock modifiers
    {{ card("Forced March") }} and
    {{ card("Freak Drive") }}, but also
    {{ card("Majesty") }} if an action is blocked and
    {{ card("Mylan Horseed") }} if he is drawn.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Enchant Kindred") }} can be used in the game beginning
    to get vampires out faster and cheaper.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("The Kiss of Ra") }} and
    {{ card("Strange Day") }} are expensive but can be kept in hand
    for a lunge action, be it a vote or a bleed.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Scourge of the Enochians") }} is a counter
    against breed decks, {{ card("Fear of Mekhet") }} against
    Inner Circle decks. Both of a them are quite a threat to this archetype.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Other card can easily be included in the deck:
    {{ card("Falhu Shibaba") }} in the crypt
    (although he does not have <i>o</i>), {{ card("Perfectionist") }}
    to get some blood back on the vampires,
    {{ card("Scalpel Tongue") }}
    to help getting the votes through, and some <i>c</i> and <i>f</i> combat cards.
    Some variants may be more toolboxy.
    {{ card("No Secrets From the Magaji") }}
    is an excellent defence card and is even included here, but it can be accompanied by a bit more equipments
    and combat options, like {{ link("/deck-search", _("Adam Hulse's deck"), twda_id="2014won5co") }} from 2014.
</p>
<p>
    An <strong>Anarch</strong> variant has also been played by
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Marcin Szybkowski"), twda_id="2k9bjpp") }} in 2009.
