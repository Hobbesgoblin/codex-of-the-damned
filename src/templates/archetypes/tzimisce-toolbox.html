<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck using the Tzimisce and their <i>VAI</i> disciplines.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module uses
    {{ card("Chiropteran Marauder") }} for aggravated damage,
    Intercept is high with 27 reactions combining <i>A</i> and <i>I</i>.
    Political actions are used to deliver pool damage with
    {{ card("Kine Resources Contested") }}
    while {{ card("Changeling") }} and
    {{ card("Mind of the Wilds") }} are used for stealth.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Blood Doll") }} and
    {{ card("Villein") }} are used to get some pool back.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is a bit slow but very difficult to predict for opponents.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    This version of the deck includes <em>a lot</em> of cards in only 1 copy. This is a bit rare,
    but it makes the deck even harder to figure out for opponents. One should be careful to keep the opponents
    guessing as to what the deck can really do.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Under Siege") }} is a powerful deterrent against the predator:
    knowing wakes are available is far more troublesome than suspecting one has it in had.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There is a lot of room for variations, including in the crypt:
    {{ card("Sascha Vykos, The Angel of Caine") }},
    {{ card("Stravinsky") }} or
    {{ card("Meshenka") }} can get a star position with 3 copies.
</p>
<p>
    A bit more permanent intercept is a common inclusion, with
    {{ card("Bowl of Convergence") }},
    {{ card("Revenant") }} and
    {{ card("Mr. Winthrop") }}.
    Permanent bleed enhancement is often included too, be it with
    {{ card("Pulse of the Canaille") }},
    {{ card("J. S. Simmons, Esq.") }} and
    {{ card("Tasha Morgan") }}, or
    {{ card("Living Manse") }}.

    displayDeck({"author":null,"comments":"It's a vote deck with a lot of toolbox, defense, and agg strikes.\nI originally had built a tournament-level Terrifisto deck, and I also had a\nLambach deck in my casual deck supply (which used goofy stuff like Deploy the Hand).\nI played the Terrifisto deck at the LCQ #1, and I found it to be quite\nunderwhelming. So I started a deck retrofit the morning of the tournament,\nusing the Lambach crypt, and the Terrifisto library. Removing ~8 fortitude cards from\nthe Terrifisto deck gave me some creative space to work with.\n\nEven for a crypt that has great access to untap and intercept\neffects, putting an Under Siege on the table is really powerful. I simply get\nthe freedom to tap out and my predator knows I have untap/intercept sitting on\nthe table. Add Lambach's agg threat on top of that.\n\nIf he gets stolen, he can trash the Black Forest Base. I know\nit's a bit corner case, but you do have to watch out for it. Otherwise you're\ngoing to endure some serious gloating when someone actually pulls it off.\n\nIt's been said before, but it's worth repeating:\nThis card is amazingly good and other players don't even see how you're building\nthe perfect hand at the start of your turn. This card directly got me the winning\nvp, as I drew into two Changelings at just the right time.\n\nI like this card, but it's very hard to remember to use it\nin every untap phase (including your own) For some reason I had particular trouble\nremembering to use it in my prey's untap phase.\n\nThis is a great card, but I'm always hesitant to add it\nto decks because it adds table chatter. If you use it, be prepared for the\ncross-table begging and have a ready yes/no answer prepared so it doesn't\nstall the game.\n","crypt":{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":3,"id":"200810","name":"Lambach"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"201434","name":"Velya, The Flayer"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"201244","name":"Sascha Vykos, The Angel of Caine"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"201245","name":"Sascha Vykos, The Angel of Caine (ADV)"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"200716","name":"John Paleologus"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"201319","name":"Stravinsky"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"200980","name":"Meshenka"},{"comments":"Should actually be Devin Bisley, but I didn't have a copy on hand.\n","count":1,"id":"200415","name":"Elizabeth Westcott"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"200850","name":"Lolita Houston"}],"count":12},"date":"2014-06-14","event":"NAC 2014 Day 2","library":{"cards":[{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":4,"id":"100199","name":"Blood Doll"},{"comments":null,"count":4,"id":"102121","name":"Villein"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100165","name":"Black Forest Base"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100710","name":"Fear of Mekhet"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100824","name":"Giant's Blood"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100842","name":"Golconda: Inner Peace"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100984","name":"Information Highway"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101102","name":"Library Hunting Ground"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101437","name":"Powerbase: Madrid"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101877","name":"Storage Annex"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100023","name":"The Admonitions"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"102151","name":"Wash"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"102180","name":"Wider View"}],"count":19,"type":"Master"},{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"102063","name":"Under Siege"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100006","name":"Abbot"},{"comments":"Could probably be a Deep Song, in case you want to rush.
