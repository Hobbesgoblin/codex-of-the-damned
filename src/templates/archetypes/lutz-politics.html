<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth bleed & vote</em> deck starring
    {{ card("Unmada") }},
    {{ card("Lutz von Hohenzollern") }} and
    {{ card("Undele") }}.
    It uses {{ card("Zillah's Valley") }}
    to get these big capacity vampires in play quickly, then
    {{ card("Parity Shift") }} and
    {{ card("Villein") }} to get some pool back.
</p>
<p>
    The sheer number of votes the vampire have makes sure they get the vote lock around the table.
    Stealth is high, with 16 stealth modifiers, and allows the vampire to bleed and vote safely.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Mental Maze") }} is used to defend against rush actions
    and {{ card("Telepathic Misdirection") }}
    against too powerful bleeds.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is slow but sturdy and applies constant high pressure to its prey.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Voter Captivation") }} is used to get pool back on the
    vampires after {{ card("Villein") }}.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Banishment") }} is used to get rid of cumbersome vampires.
    It can either weaken the prey, slow down the predator, or even be used cross table to maintain
    the table balance if necessary.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is deliberately compact with only 70 cards.
    This enhances the chances to get the many cards that are played in only one copy.
    As the game progresses, {{ card("Undele") }}'s ability
    can be used for recursion, getting the cards most adapted to the table context back in hand.
</p>
<p>
    Many Master cards cost quite a bit of pool, but this is in fact a feature of the deck: this allows the
    player to get its own pool down in order to be able to play a
    {{ card("Parity Shift") }} on his prey.
</p>
<h2>Creator Insights</h2>
<p>
    <em>Maxime Socroun</em> was kind enough to provide the following insights:
</p>
<p>
    Since the <em>errata</em> on {{ card("Parity Shift") }},
    I feel like this version of the deck is not playable anymore and it drives me crazy.
</p>
<p>
    There may still be a way to make the <strong>Maris Lutz</strong> variant work, though.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Replacing {{ card("Rafael de Corazon") }}
    by a second {{ card("Dmitra Ilyanova") }}
    allows for the inclusion of
    {{ card("Forced March") }} as she,
    {{ card("Unmada") }} and
    {{ card("Undele") }} can use it.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Maris Lutz</strong> variant uses a group 3-4 crypt with
    {{ card("Maris Streck") }}, like
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Danilo Torrisi's deck"), twda_id="2016eclvgi") }} from the 2016 EC.
    Using more Malkavian in the crypt makes
    {{ card("Madness Network") }} a useful inclusion.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Helicopter</strong> variant uses the {{ card("Alastor") }} +
    {{ card("Helicopter") }} combination to enable
    {{ card("Lutz") }} to vote <em>and</em> bleed in the same turn,
    like in {{ link("/deck-search", _("Fabien Garcia's deck"), twda_id="2014ecfcqmg") }} from 2014 EC FCQ.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>AD&D</strong> variant uses
    {{ card("Derange") }} and
    {{ card("Malkavian Dementia") }},
    like {{ link("/deck-search", _("Otso Saariluoma's deck"), twda_id="2010finnishecq") }} from 2010.
    This combination can steal any vampire, robbing them of their blood and equipment using
    {{ card("Heidelberg Castle, Germany") }},
    or even destroying them for pool with
    {{ card("Golconda: Inner Peace") }},
    provided one can get a second Master Action with
    {{ card("Cybele") }} or
    {{ card("The Parthenon") }}.
