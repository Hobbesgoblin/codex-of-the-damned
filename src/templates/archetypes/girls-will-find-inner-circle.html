<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck centered around the use of multiple Master actions
    and a lot of actions cards. This is commonly reffered to as a <strong>M</strong>ulti
    <strong>M</strong>aster <strong>P</strong>hase <strong>A</strong>ctions construct.
</p>
<p>
    The base idea is to get {{ card("Cybele") }} out, then
    {{ card("Aksinya Daclau") }}, using
    {{ card("Zillah's Valley") }} and
    {{ card("Villein") }} to get them out faster.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Cybele") }} ability provides more master phase actions, while
    {{ card("Aksinya Daclau") }}'s ability also uses the Master cards
    for bleed defence, providing a permanent bounce.
</p>
<p>
    The deck has an exceptional bloat capacity, between {{ card("Villein") }},
    {{ card("Liquidation") }} and
    {{ card("Ashur Tablets") }}.
</p>
<p>
    While the game progresses, big capacity vampires with a strong permanent bleed bonus and <i>O</i>
    are put into play. They proceed to destroying the prey's pool using <i>O</i> stealth and their inherent
    bleed bonus.
</p>
<p>
    The high number of {{ card("Ashur Tablets") }} provide
    an exceptional recursion. The more the game advances, the more the deck concentrates the cards it needs
    the most, depending on the table context and the opponents decks.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Aksinya Daclau") }} needs to be unlocked to use her ability.
    That's why the deck uses {{ card("Guard Dogs") }} and
    {{ card("Rat's Warning") }}.
</p>
<p>
    The crypt uses vampires with <i>O</i> and <i>R</i>, so they can use
    {{ card("Entrancement") }} and
    {{ card("Majesty") }}. However, most vampires do not have access to
    <i>d</i> or <i>A</i> for additional bounces.
    As the vampires have a very big capacity though,
    {{ card("Lost in Translation") }} provide additional bounces
    in case of a very aggressive predator.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Many small variations exists, depending on the cards used outside the Master module.
</p>
<p>
    A common variation is the <strong>Girls Will Find AIDS</strong>, more combat-focused and using
    {{ card("Nana Buruku") }} and a <i>I</i> combat module using
    {{ card("Deep Song") }},
    {{ card("Aid From Bats") }}, and
    {{ card("Carrion Crows") }}.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Hugh Angseesing's deck"), twda_id="2011fcqco") }} from the 2011 NAC FCQ
    is a good example.
