<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck built around the Tremere clan and their <i>adt</i> disciplines.
    <i>d</i> is used to bleed, bounce bleeds and accelerate the crypt with
    {{ card("Govern the Unaligned") }} and
    {{ card("Scouting Mission") }}.
    <i>a</i> is used for wakes, intercept and bounces.
    <i>t</i> is used for combat and a bit of stealth with
    {{ card("Mirror Walk") }}.
</p>
<p>
    As the deck does not have much stealth, it uses <em>powerbleed</em> tools to lock the prey vampires
    and make sure they won't be able to block or bounce, with
    {{ card("Misdirection") }},
    {{ card("Anarch Troublemaker") }} and
    {{ card("Pentex™ Subversion") }}.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Theft of Vitae") }} is an excellent combat card, as it
    usually produces a 4 blood differential for no cost. Against some modules though,
    it can be a bit weak. The use of
    {{ card("Apportation") }} and
    {{ card("Blood Fury") }} helps with that.
    It is great against weapons-oriented modules, and can be played when the opponent uses
    {{ card("Immortal Grapple") }}: it is a nasty surprise
    against <i>fp</i> combat modules.
</p>
<p>
    Using {{ card("Threats") }} alongside
    {{ card("Conditioning") }} provides some
    liberty of action if an opponent plays
    a {{ card("Direct Intervention") }} on the latter:
    the cancelled modifier cannot be played again on the same action,
    but another bleed enhancer can.
    The most direct advantage though is that it is cheaper and keeps a bit more blood on the vampires.
</p>
<h2>Creator Insights</h2>
<p>
    <em>Daniel Gargulák</em> was kind enough to provide insights:
</p>
<p>
    Rotation is quite important in the deck.
    {{ card("The Barrens") }},
    {{ card("Dreams of the Sphinx") }} and
    {{ card("Heart of Nizchetus") }} help in this regard.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Misdirection") }},
    {{ card("Anarch Troublemaker") }} and
    {{ card("Pentex™ Subversion") }} should be kept in hand until
    it is time for the lunge.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Theft of Vitae") }} is especially good because it handles
    {{ card("Emerald Legionnaire") }} and
    {{ card("Nephandus") }} easily. That's why there is only a single
    {{ card("Far Mastery") }} to handle the more rare werewolf allies.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Blood Fury") }} is a nice surprise:
    it is good in many situations, be it against weapons or against a <i>f</i> wall, as both are common.
</p>
<p>
    When going for a bleed, {{ card("Scouting Mission") }} and
    {{ card("Threats") }} make sure that even a vampire with only 1 blood left
    can still get a bleed modifier, thus keeping the prey on her toes.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    They are multiple variants on the combat module. It can use aggravated damages with
    {{ card("Flames of the Netherworld") }} and
    {{ card("Walk of Flame") }}, for example.
    {{ card("Magic of the Smith") }} is also played often,
    in order to fetch a
    {{ card("Bowl of Convergence") }},
    {{ card("Heart of Nizchetus") }},
    {{ card("Ivory bow") }} or
    {{ card("Sniper Rifle") }}.
    Also, {{ card("Ponticulus") }} is often included for his excellent
    defence abilities.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Royalty</strong> variant uses <em>Princes</em> and <em>Justicars</em>,
    adding political actions and
    {{ card("Second Tradition: Domain") }} to the mix.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Ricardo Molina Sobreira's deck"), twda_id="2018sacsbp") }}
    from the 2018 SAC is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Infernal</strong> variant uses
    {{ card("Valerius Maior, Hell's Fool (ADV)") }} instead of
    {{ card("Carna, The Princess Witch") }}.
    His ability is fearsome and its <em>Infernal</em> trait and <i>Y</i> give him access to good options like
    {{ card("Flames of the Netherworld") }} and
    {{ card("Unleash Hell's Fury") }}.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Pau Vilar's deck"), twda_id="2018igpbi") }} from 2018 is a good example.
