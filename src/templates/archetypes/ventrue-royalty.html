<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck using Ventrue <em>Princes</em>.
</p>
<p>
    The idea is to get the highest capacity vampire out,
    then use {{ card("Govern the Unaligned") }}
    at superior <i>D</i> to get more vampires out fast and cheap, then later to bleed with the help of
    some <i>d</i> modifiers.
</p>
<p>
    The intercept module is built around the fact the many vampires in the crypt are <em>Princes</em> and uses
    {{ card("Second Tradition: Domain") }} heavily.
    {{ card("Deflection") }} is used to bounce bleeds in case
    they get thtough anyway.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module uses <i>f</i> for damage prevention and
    {{ card("Weighted Walking Stick") }} to deal
    more damage.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Daring the Dawn") }} and
    {{ card("Foreshadowing Destruction") }}
    are used for the lunge.
    The use of {{ card("Direct Intervention") }} on a modifier
    like {{ card("Conditioning") }} prevents it to be played again on the
    same action (as a modifier can only be played once, even if countered).
    Using an alternative bleed enhancer is permitted though
    (the modifier did not apply, so limited bleed enhancement is still possible).
    {{ card("Foreshadowing Destruction") }}
    can even save a lunge this way.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Scourge of the Enochians") }} and
    {{ card("Anarchist Uprising") }} are counters against
    breed constructs, as they can become overwhelming for this deck.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    There are many minor variations to this archetype.
    {{ card("Parity Shift") }} and
    {{ card("Entrancement") }} are often included,
    {{ card("Seduction") }} can help to get the bleed through.
    On the Master side,
    {{ card("Papillon") }} and
    {{ card("Island of Yiaros") }} are common inclusions.
    Finally, some
    {{ card("Freak Drive") }} to increase
    {{ link("/strategy/fundamentals", _("A&B"), _anchor="AB") }}w is often seen too.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Law Firm</strong> variant ditches the combat module and replaces it with some
    {{ card("Majesty") }}, with a good number of
    {{ card("Freak Drive") }} for multiple actions.
    With more damaging votes like
    {{ card("Kine Resources Contested") }},
    it makes for many aggressive actions, and they quickly become hard to block.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Anthony Coleman's deck"), twda_id="2k9uknats") }} from the 2009 English NC
    is a good example. It is also often played with a group 1-2 crypt, as
    {{ card("Emerson Bridges") }} and
    {{ card("Sir Walter Nash") }} are good Princes
    for the job, at a low cost.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Sergio Gracia's deck"), twda_id="2k9powerbasecataluna") }} from 2009
    is a good example.
