<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is an <em>allies toolbox</em> deck using multiple unique allies. The idea is to put
    {{ card("Khazar's Diary (Endless Night)") }}
    into play, breed a bit with {{ card("The Embrace") }},
    defend by putting some allies into play and wait until
    {{ card("Khazar's Diary") }}
    triggers. At this point, the dead allies come back into play as wraith to stealth & bleed the
    successive preys out of the game.
</p>
<p>
    The high recursion using {{ card("Sudario Refraction") }}
    is a strong point of the deck, allowing it to adapt its defence to the table context.
    It is very passive in the game beginning and uses
    {{ card("Deflection") }} and
    {{ card("Delaying Tactics") }} to defend a much as possible.
</p>
<p>
    The deck is focused on bringing as many minions into play as possible, and relies a lot on the allies
    and their capacities. As such, it does have only limited combat, bleed or stealth modules.
    However, it hopes to quickly bring into play good rush or intercept allies like
    {{ card("Carlton Van Wyk") }},
    {{ card("Ossian") }} and
    {{ card("Shambling Hordes") }} to improve its defence.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Shambling Hordes") }} is a particularily strong
    rush minion: it is not <em>Unique</em> (and as such does not add a counter to
    {{ card("Khazar's Diary") }}
    when it burns), but it is strong enough a defence to be included nonetheless.
    And given the rest of the deck mechanics and the numerous
    {{ card("Liquidation") }},
    it will easily find an ally in the ash heap.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("The Unmasking") }} and
    {{ card("FBI Special Affairs Division") }} help
    making all these allies stronger defenders when they come into play.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Jake Washington") }} is an excellent device in this deck
    as burning him in any way will add one counter on
    {{ card("Khazar's Diary") }} easily.
</p>
<p>
    This variant uses {{ card("The Parthenon") }}
    to get to play more masters and improve its bloat with
    {{ card("Liquidation") }} and
    {{ card("Vessel") }}.
    Destroying some {{ card("Blood Doll") }} using
    {{ card("Vessel") }} has a bit of value in this deck, as
    {{ card("Gregory Winter") }} and
    {{ card("Young Bloods") }} can stack over the rush allies
    to bring a strong blood attrition to the table.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Repo Man") }} is a cheap unique ally,
    and, with his 1 life, dies pretty quickly if he blocks. Which is the point when one uses
    {{ card("Khazar's Diary") }}.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Minor variations exist, for example
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Iñaki Puigdollers's deck"), twda_id="2k9ecminiqsabadell") }} from 2009 uses
    {{ card("Change of Target") }} to help protect the minions
    — even the allies — from unforseen blocks. He also included some
    {{ card("Tupdogs") }} in the crypt:
    they can not undertake directed actions but they avoid repeating minions in the crypt,
    they can still block, recruit an ally like the {{ card("Repo Man") }},
    and provide one more minion to bring back as a wraith once
    {{ card("Khazar's Diary") }}
    kicks in.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Anarch</strong> variant, as seen in
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Roberto Venturi's deck"), twda_id="2011itamassa") }} from 2011, uses
    {{ card("Anarch Convert") }} for a better rotation and to make
    all these Giovanni Anarch, so they can use
    {{ card("Cry Wolf") }}, an exceptionnaly well suited ally for the
    {{ card("Khazar's Diary") }}:
    it is unique and burns automatically. It provides the same kind of rush defence
    {{ card("Ossian") }} and
    {{ card("Shambling Hordes") }} do in the example deck.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Faeries</strong> variant was played in
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Enrico De Stefano's deck"), twda_id="2018eclcqwp") }} from 2018. It uses a dozen
    {{ card("Draeven Softfoot") }} and their burn option
    to quickly bring more allies into the ash heap, making it easier to get
    {{ card("Shambling Hordes") }} into play.
    It also uses more copies of {{ card("The Embrace") }} and
    {{ card("Khazar's Diary") }}
    as the idea is to trigger the Diary sooner, and bring all these
    {{ card("Draeven Softfoot") }} back as wraith with the new born vampires,
    for a faster, more aggressive version of the archetype.
