<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>rush</em> deck using {{ card("Deep Song") }} to rush
    or bleed and a <i>i</i> combat module with
    {{ card("Carrion Crows") }} and
    {{ card("Aid from Bats") }}.
</p>
<p>
    Using {{ card("Nana Buruku") }} allow to play a lot of
    {{ card("Ashur Tablets") }} for a nice recursion.
    This lets the deck adapt to the table context while bloating a bit.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Fame") }} and
    {{ card("Dragonbound") }} are used to improve pool damage.
</p>
<p>
    Using low ad mid capacity vampires let the deck use a decent amout of naked "bleed for 1" actions or
    inferior <i>i</i> {{ card("Deep Song") }}
    to get some pool damage to its prey.
</p>
<p>
    It is a very solid deck, with good defence against the predator and decent pool damage towards its prey.
    Although it is not a very fast damage dealer, rush actions let it control the table nicely.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Powerbase: Luanda") }} and
    {{ card("Well-Marked") }} are nice tools for a rush deck.
    They can be used by both {{ card("Nana Buruku") }} and
    {{ card("Fish") }}.
</p>
<p>
    The deck does not have a lot of intercept, but plays
    {{ card("Powerbase: Montreal") }} and
    {{ card("The Rack") }} nonetheless, relying on the threat of
    a retaliation rush to protect them.
</p>
<p>
    Just including a bit of <em>wakes</em> and some intercept enhancers like
    {{ card("Cats' Guidance") }} and
    {{ card("Sense the Savage Way") }}
    keep the other players guessing on wether the deck can block or not.
</p>
<p>
    Getting {{ card("Wider View") }} at some point helps getting rid
    of the spurious {{ card("Nana Buruku") }} in crypt.
    She's also only played in 4 copies to avoid jamming the crypt too much; other minions are needed for the
    deck to work well.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The <strong>Anarch</strong> variant uses
    {{ card("Anarch Convert") }} to make the vampires anarch,
    along
    {{ card("Anarch Revolt") }} to improve pool damage,
    taking down any Anarch vampire on the prey side using rush actions.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Orian Gissler's deck"), twda_id="2018fnclf") }} from the 2018 French NC
    is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Weenie ANI</strong> plays <i>i</i> without
    {{ card("Nana Buruku") }} nor
    {{ card("Ashur Tablets") }}.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Kim Nilsson's deck"), twda_id="2016sncss") }} from the 2016 Swedish NC
    is a good example.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Toolbox</strong> variant includes more intercept, like
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Ádám Horváth's deck"), twda_id="2010hungarianecq") }} from 2010,
    with {{ card("Aranthebes, The Immortal") }} and
    {{ card("Raven Spy") }}.

    displayDeck({"author":"Matt Morgan, based on Martin Major's deck","comments":"It's rush combat with a strong master module. Master cards\nare the best in the game. I'd always rather have too many than too few.\nThe name is because the final was won 2-1-1-1 and Fish and Stick lead the\nway while Nana stayed hidden in my crypt. Fish is only in the deck to make\nit count as a Guruhi deck for TWDA purposes.\n\nOne might wonder why only 4 Nana when she's the star? The answer is that\nit's way better to have no Nana than all Nana. This deck needs a bunch of\nminion actions to succeed\n\nI really liked having AI here in the final, though I wound up not\nplaying it. Mbare Market probably isn't worth the slot. Should be a\n2nd Fame, I think. Otherwise the masters worked out very well.\n\nThe Entrancement and Well-Marked didn't really earn their keep at any\npoint, though Well-Marked is typically a free action at least. I play\nfewer Deep Songs than Martin's version because I'm not trying to rush\nwith every minion with every action. I bleed for 1 a little or stay up.\nI want my prey to go forward. I don't want to simply squish him. Coming\nout of the gate too fast is a mistake.\n\nVery few reactions. Sense the Savage Way should probably go since only\nNana can play them. I had multiple situations where I would have liked to\nblock with somebody else but couldn't because of the restriction on that\ncard. Getting to 2 intercept is nice, but it isn't worth the cost.\n\nVery consistent. Not a lot can survive repeated hits from this. Of course\nit's not fun to run into other ANI decks, but them's the breaks.\n","crypt":{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":4,"id":"201035","name":"Nana Buruku"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"200468","name":"Fish"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"200185","name":"Beetleman"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"200211","name":"Bobby Lemon"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"200353","name":"Dolie"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"201318","name":"Stick"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"201014","name":"Mouse"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"201507","name":"Zip"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"200839","name":"Lisa Noble"}],"count":12},"date":"2011-06-25","event":"NAC 2011 Day 2","library":{"cards":[{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":9,"id":"100106","name":"Ashur Tablets"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"100070","name":"Animalism"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"100199","name":"Blood Doll"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"102121","name":"Villein"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100085","name":"Archon Investigation"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100698","name":"Fame"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100824","name":"Giant's Blood"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101189","name":"Mbare Market, Harare"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101384","name":"Pentex(TM) Subversion"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101436","name":"Powerbase: Luanda"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101439","name":"Powerbase: Montreal"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101536","name":"The Rack"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"102180","name":"Wider View"}],"count":24,"type":"Master"},{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":10,"id":"100515","name":"Deep Song"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100652","name":"Entrancement"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"102172","name":"Well-Marked"}],"count":12,"type":"Action"},{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":13,"id":"100301","name":"Carrion Crows"},{"comments":null,"count":11,"id":"100029","name":"Aid from Bats"},{"comments":null,"count":4,"id":"101945","name":"Taste of Vitae"},{"comments":null,"count":3,"id":"101942","name":"Target Vitals"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100290","name":"Canine Horde"}],"count":32,"type":"Combat"},{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"100308","name":"Cats' Guidance"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"101717","name":"Sense the Savage Way"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100519","name":"Delaying Tactics"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101321","name":"On the Qui Vive"}],"count":6,"type":"Reaction"},{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101014","name":"Ivory Bow"}],"count":1,"type":"Equipment"},{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100581","name":"Dragonbound"}],"count":1,"type":"Event"}],"count":76},"name":"Salmon Fishstick","place":"Columbus, Ohio","player":"Matt Morgan","players_count":25,"score":null,"tournament_format":"3R+F","twda_id":"2011NACd2"})
