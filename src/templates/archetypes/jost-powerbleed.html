<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>powerbleed</em> deck starring
    {{ card("Rebekka, Chantry Elder of Munich") }} and
    {{ card("Jost Werner") }}. The deck uses the <i>RA</i> disciplines
    and the two star vampires have this nice permanent +1 stealth bonus that helps the deck get his actions through.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Enchant Kindred") }} is used to help get more vampires out
    in the game beginning, and bleed afterwards. {{ card("Mind Numb") }}
    can be used against the prey or the predator depending on the context, to slow them down.
</p>
<p>
    The deck uses no stealth apart from what the star vampires already have as an ability,
    but the combination of {{ card("Mind Numb") }}
    and {{ card("Majesty") }} makes it hard to block:
    {{ card("Mind Numb") }} can lock any defender and, if blocked,
    {{ card("Majesty") }} ends combat and unlock the acting vampire:
    the defender is still locked and a new action can be undertaken.
</p>
<p>
    The deck uses {{ card("Anarch Troublemaker") }} and
    {{ card("Pentex™ Subversion") }} to help paralyze the prey a
    bit more. When bleeds begin to get through,
    {{ card("Aire of Elation") }} can be used to enhance them.
</p>
<p>
    If a bleed is bounced, it uses no stealth so it can usually be blocker by the grand-prey.
    The deck himself uses <i>A</i> for wakes and bounces, so it can add the bleed power of its
    predator to its own.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Entrancement") }} can help get rid of cumbersome allies,
    {{ card("Scourge of the Enochians") }} is there to
    deal with breed constructs.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Delaying Tactics") }} is the only defence available
    against stealth & vote builds: as {{ card("Eyes of Argus") }}
    can not be used against undirected political actions, intercept can never go beyond 2.
</p>
<p>
    The deck plays a lot of bounces with
    {{ card("Telepathic Misdirection") }} and
    {{ card("My Enemy's Enemy") }}. They can also be used to block
    key actions on the opponents side.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The <strong>Palla Grande</strong> variant uses a Toreador antitribu crypt, so it can use
    {{ card("Palla Grande") }} to increase the bleed power, like in
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Moisés Ferrer's deck"), twda_id="2018ccpms") }} from 2018.
    {{ card("Art Scam") }} and
    {{ card("The Embrace") }}
    are used to strengthen both the bloat and the pool damages.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Paolini-Detela</strong> variant uses
    {{ card("The Parthenon") }} and
    {{ card("Ashur Tablets") }} to get a bit of recursion
    and help adapt the deck content to the table context.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Martin Weinmayer's deck"), twda_id="2018nacd1co") }} from the 2018 NAC Day 1
    was an hommage to it.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Anson</strong> variant ditches
    {{ card("Rebekka") }} in favor of
    {{ card("Anson") }} to help play the
    {{ card("Ashur Tablets") }} with less copies of
    {{ card("The Parthenon") }} and add
    {{ card("Liquidation") }} to the mix, like in
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Rudolf Scholz's deck"), twda_id="2012dnccd") }} from the 2012 Danish NC.
