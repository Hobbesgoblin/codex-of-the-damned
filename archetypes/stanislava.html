    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        This is a <em>stealth vote & bleed</em> deck with
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('stanislava')">Stanislava</span> as a star. She uses
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('governtheunaligned')">Govern the Unaligned</span> to help get other
        vampires out and <span class="card" onclick="dC('villein')">Villein</span> is used to get some pool
        back. The second vampire should be a <em>Prince</em>,
        preferrably <span class="card" onclick="dC('ingridrossler')">Ingrid Rossler</span>,
        to be able to play the numerous <span class="card" onclick="dC('parityshift')">Parity Shift</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the game progresses, more big capacity titled vampires get out and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('parityshift')">Parity Shift</span> is used both to deliver pool damage and to
        bloat. Vampires begin to bleed, using <i>j</i> for stealth with
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('formofmist')">Form of Mist</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('earthcontrol')">Earth Control</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('rapidchange')">Rapid Change</span>.
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('deflection')">Deflection</span> is used for bleed defence, with some
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('sensethesavageway')">Sense the Savage Way</span> to unlock if need be.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('forcedmarch')">Forced March</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('instantaneoustransformation')">Instantaneous Transformation</span> are
        extremely versatile as they can be used both for stealth or additional action, allowing a vampire
        to bleed and call a vote in the same turn.
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('stanislava')">Stanislava</span> can use both,
        but some other vampires in the crypt can use one or the other.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('murmurofthefalsewill')">Murmur of the False Will</span> can be used
        both for bounces and bleed enhancement, depending on the context. However, they're not supposed to be used
        with <span class="card" onclick="dC('stanislava')">Stanislava</span> herself, as bleeding for more than 3
        would expose her to <span class="card" onclick="dC('archoninvestigation')">Archon Investigation</span>,
        a chance one would be wary to take with this deck.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <em>Prince</em> is required, not only for the
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('parityshift')">Parity Shift</span>, but also for
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('papillon')">Papillon</span>, an excellent device to bring some blood
        back on the vampires. <span class="card" onclick="dC('jakewashington')">Jake Washington</span> is also a very
        efficient tool to that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <span class="card" onclick="dC('sealofveddartha')">Seal of Veddartha</span> is an excellent
        equipment with this crypt, as most vampires miss either <i>D</i> or <i>F</i>. The +1 bleed bonus is nothing
        to cast aside either.
    </p>
    <h2>Variants</h2>
    <p>
        The archetype is very much known for <em>Martin Weinmayer's</em> build as he as been very successful with it
        and retained the top seat in the international classment for some years.
        The cards proportions may vary a little bit, some like to play some
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('guarddogs')">Guard Dogs</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('kineresourcescontested')">Kine Resources Contested</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('veleshunt')">Vele's Hunt</span> and/or
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('clawsofthedead')">Claws of the Dead</span>.
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('ecoterrorists')">Ecoterrorists</span> is also a common inclusion.
        Some alterations have been seen in the crypt too, like ditching
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('rachelbrandywine')">Rachel Brandywine</span> for an additional
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('ingridrossler')">Ingrid Rossler</span> or including
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('iliana')">Iliana</span> or
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('caitlin')">Caitlin</span>,
        as they have excellent disciplines combination for a low pool,
        although no title to support the political side of the deck.
        <a href="../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2016rfehf">Janne Lönnqvist's deck</a> from 2016 is a good example.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Old School</strong> variant uses groups 1 and 2 in the crypt instead of the group 2-3 used here.
        It provides <span class="card" onclick="dC('angustheunruled')">Angus the Unruled</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('doncrueztheidealist')">Don Cruez, The Idealist</span>,
        two justicars with a nice sets of disciplines. It allows for more Royalty cards like
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('secondtraditiondomain')">Second Tradition: Domain</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('fourthtraditiontheaccounting')">Fourth Tradition: The Accounting</span>.
        <a href="../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2014gtdtigi">Giulio De Cicco's deck</a> from 2014 is a good example.
    </p>
    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Errata</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('pentextmsubversion')">Pentex™ Subversion</span>
            has been modified by an <em>errata</em> in September 2019.
            It does not prevent a vampire to act anymore, so it is less powerful
            and should maybe not be included in the deck anymore.
            Still its ability to disable a strong blocker is useful for the lunge.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('parityshift')">Parity Shift</span>
            has also been modified in the September 2019 <em>errata</em>.
            The amount of pool is no longer equal to the number of Methusalah, but is stable at 3.
            The card is then less powerful in the game beginning, and should maybe be included in less copies.
