    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck starring
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('unnamedthe')">The unnamed</span>.
        The idea is to use his ability to bleed and bloat at the same time.
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('tendtheflock')">Tend the Flock</span> is used to improve the bloat.
    </p>
    <p>
        At some point in the game, he gets <span class="card" onclick="dC('enkilcog')">Enkil Cog</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('homunculus')">Homunculus</span>, allowing him to bleed again
        during another turn, doubling his bleed and bloat power.
    </p>
    <p>
        The versatile
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('instantaneoustransformation')">Instantaneous Transformation</span>
        is a great asset and other options are included to let him unlock as much as possible:
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('homunculus')">Homunculus</span>, but also
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('eludingthearmsofmorpheus')">Eluding the Arms of Morpheus</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('mylanhorseed')">Mylan Horseed</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('majesty')">Majesty</span>.
        The more he unlocks, the less the Methusalah has to pay for the <em>Infernal</em> penalty.
    </p>
    <p>
        His threatening combat ability makes unlocking and trying to block a real threat —
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('sensethesin')">Sense the Sin</span> becomes more versatile than in most
        Baali decks.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('flurryofaction')">Flurry of Action</span> is rarely played overall, but very
        typical of this archetype. It lets <span class="card" onclick="dC('unnamedthe')">The unnamed</span>
        bleed and unlock with a single card, at no cost. A bleed enhancement action is less useful than
        it can be in other decks, since
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('sensethesin')">Sense the Sin</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('truelovesface')">True Love's Face</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('enkilcog')">Enkil Cog</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('hordethe')">The Horde</span> already provide enough bleed enhancement,
        and the deck never bleeds over 3 because of
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('archoninvestigation')">Archon Investigation</span> anyway.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('rotschreck')">Rötschreck</span> is a nice surprise that can disable quite
        any combat module if used with <span class="card" onclick="dC('unnamedthe')">The unnamed</span>
        ability when blocking.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('infernalservitor')">Infernal Servitor</span> is a powerful bleeder
        and can even use <i>o</i> for some stealth. Moreover, it can be played twice in a turn, back-to-back.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('shadowofthebeast')">Shadow of the Beast</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('kaymaklifragment')">Kaymakli Fragment</span> are rare inclusions and
        <em>Darby Keeney</em> comments they could be cut.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('maskofathousandfaces')">Mask of a Thousand Faces</span> is seldom played,
        but here it lets <span class="card" onclick="dC('unnamedthe')">The unnamed</span> "takeover" when
        someone unexpectedly blocks a sidekick.
    </p>
    <p>
        The whole deck tends to cost a bit of blood, so
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('perfectionist')">Perfectionist</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('giantsblood')">Giant's Blood</span> are played to help restore
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('unnamedthe')">The unnamed</span>'s blood.
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('coventhe')">The Coven</span> is also common.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('iamlegion')">I am Legion</span> is versatile: it
        can be used to counter some <i>a</i> intercept or bounces
        but can also be used just for 1 pool on a successful action:
        the card text states <em>"and/<strong>or</strong> gain 1 pool"</em>.
    </p>
    <h2>Variants</h2>
    <p>
        Many small variations exist over the minion cards.
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('formofmist')">Form of Mist</span> is often included for its versatility.
        and <span class="card" onclick="dC('dhabirevenant')">D'habi Revenant</span> as a bleed enhancer.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Legal</strong> variant disregards the
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('enkilcog')">Enkil Cog</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('homunculus')">Homunculus</span> combination and replaces
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('flurryofaction')">Flurry of Action</span> with
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('legalmanipulations')">Legal Manipulations</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Maleficia</strong> variant plays <span class="card" onclick="dC('maleficia')">Maleficia</span>
        and uses <span class="card" onclick="dC('psalmofthedamned')">Psalm of the Damned</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('greatercurse')">Greater Curse</span> and/or
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('evileye')">Evil Eye</span> to improve the deck.
        <a href="../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2017vplnebspb">Fernando Naves Resck's deck</a> from 2017
        Brazilian CCQ is a good example.
    </p>
    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Errata</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('pentextmsubversion')">Pentex™ Subversion</span>
            has been modified by an <em>errata</em> in September 2019.
            It does not prevent a vampire to act anymore, so it is less powerful
            and should maybe not be included in the deck anymore.
            Still its ability to disable a strong blocker is useful for the lunge.
