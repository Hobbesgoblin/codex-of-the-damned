    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        This is an <em>allies toolbox</em> deck using multiple unique allies. The idea is to put
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('khazarsdiaryendlessnight')">Khazar's Diary (Endless Night)</span>
        into play, breed a bit with <span class="card" onclick="dC('embracethe')">The Embrace</span>,
        defend by putting some allies into play and wait until
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('khazarsdiaryendlessnight')">Khazar's Diary</span>
        triggers. At this point, the dead allies come back into play as wraith to stealth & bleed the
        successive preys out of the game.
    </p>
    <p>
        The high recursion using <span class="card" onclick="dC('sudariorefraction')">Sudario Refraction</span>
        is a strong point of the deck, allowing it to adapt its defence to the table context.
        It is very passive in the game beginning and uses
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('deflection')">Deflection</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('delayingtactics')">Delaying Tactics</span> to defend a much as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        The deck is focused on bringing as many minions into play as possible, and relies a lot on the allies
        and their capacities. As such, it does have only limited combat, bleed or stealth modules.
        However, it hopes to quickly bring into play good rush or intercept allies like
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('carltonvanwyk')">Carlton Van Wyk</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('ossian')">Ossian</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('shamblinghordes')">Shambling Hordes</span> to improve its defence.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('shamblinghordes')">Shambling Hordes</span> is a particularily strong
        rush minion: it is not <em>Unique</em> (and as such does not add a counter to
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('khazarsdiaryendlessnight')">Khazar's Diary</span>
        when it burns), but it is strong enough a defence to be included nonetheless.
        And given the rest of the deck mechanics and the numerous
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('liquidation')">Liquidation</span>,
        it will easily find an ally in the ash heap.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('unmaskingthe')">The Unmasking</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('fbispecialaffairsdivision')">FBI Special Affairs Division</span> help
        making all these allies stronger defenders when they come into play.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('jakewashington')">Jake Washington</span> is an excellent device in this deck
        as burning him in any way will add one counter on
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('khazarsdiaryendlessnight')">Khazar's Diary</span> easily.
    </p>
    <p>
        This variant uses <span class="card" onclick="dC('parthenonthe')">The Parthenon</span>
        to get to play more masters and improve its bloat with
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('liquidation')">Liquidation</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('vessel')">Vessel</span>.
        Destroying some <span class="card" onclick="dC('blooddoll')">Blood Doll</span> using
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('vessel')">Vessel</span> has a bit of value in this deck, as
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('gregorywinter')">Gregory Winter</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('youngbloods')">Young Bloods</span> can stack over the rush allies
        to bring a strong blood attrition to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('repoman')">Repo Man</span> is a cheap unique ally,
        and, with his 1 life, dies pretty quickly if he blocks. Which is the point when one uses
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('khazarsdiaryendlessnight')">Khazar's Diary</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>Variants</h2>
    <p>
        Minor variations exist, for example
        <a href="../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2k9ecminiqsabadell">Iñaki Puigdollers's deck</a> from 2009 uses
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('changeoftarget')">Change of Target</span> to help protect the minions
        — even the allies — from unforseen blocks. He also included some
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('tupdog')">Tupdogs</span> in the crypt:
        they can not undertake directed actions but they avoid repeating minions in the crypt,
        they can still block, recruit an ally like the <span class="card" onclick="dC('repoman')">Repo Man</span>,
        and provide one more minion to bring back as a wraith once
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('khazarsdiaryendlessnight')">Khazar's Diary</span>
        kicks in.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Anarch</strong> variant, as seen in
        <a href="../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2011itamassa">Roberto Venturi's deck</a> from 2011, uses
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('anarchconvert')">Anarch Convert</span> for a better rotation and to make
        all these Giovanni Anarch, so they can use
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('crywolf')">Cry Wolf</span>, an exceptionnaly well suited ally for the
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('khazarsdiaryendlessnight')">Khazar's Diary</span>:
        it is unique and burns automatically. It provides the same kind of rush defence
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('ossian')">Ossian</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('shamblinghordes')">Shambling Hordes</span> do in the example deck.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Faeries</strong> variant was played in
        <a href="../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2018eclcqwp">Enrico De Stefano's deck</a> from 2018. It uses a dozen
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('draevensoftfoot')">Draeven Softfoot</span> and their burn option
        to quickly bring more allies into the ash heap, making it easier to get
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('shamblinghordes')">Shambling Hordes</span> into play.
        It also uses more copies of <span class="card" onclick="dC('embracethe')">The Embrace</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('khazarsdiaryendlessnight')">Khazar's Diary</span>
        as the idea is to trigger the Diary sooner, and bring all these
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('draevensoftfoot')">Draeven Softfoot</span> back as wraith with the new born vampires,
        for a faster, more aggressive version of the archetype.
    </p>
    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Errata</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('pentextmsubversion')">Pentex™ Subversion</span>
            has been modified by an <em>errata</em> in September 2019.
            It does not prevent a vampire to act anymore, so it is less powerful
            and should maybe not be included in the deck anymore.
            Still its ability to disable a strong blocker is useful for the lunge.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('antheliostheredstar')">Anthelios, The Red Star</span> has been
            banned in 2016. It should not be included in the deck anymore. Its absence makes the inclusion
            of <span class="card" onclick="dC('parthenonthe')">The Parthenon</span> and so many Master cards
            questionable.
