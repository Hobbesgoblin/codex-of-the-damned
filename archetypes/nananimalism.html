    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        This is a <em>rush</em> deck using <span class="card" onclick="dC('deepsong')">Deep Song</span> to rush
        or bleed and a <i>i</i> combat module with
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('carrioncrows')">Carrion Crows</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('aidfrombats')">Aid from Bats</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using <span class="card" onclick="dC('nanaburuku')">Nana Buruku</span> allow to play a lot of
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('ashurtablets')">Ashur Tablets</span> for a nice recursion.
        This lets the deck adapt to the table context while bloating a bit.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('fame')">Fame</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('dragonbound')">Dragonbound</span> are used to improve pool damage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using low ad mid capacity vampires let the deck use a decent amout of naked "bleed for 1" actions or
        inferior <i>i</i> <span class="card" onclick="dC('deepsong')">Deep Song</span>
        to get some pool damage to its prey.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is a very solid deck, with good defence against the predator and decent pool damage towards its prey.
        Although it is not a very fast damage dealer, rush actions let it control the table nicely.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('powerbaseluanda')">Powerbase: Luanda</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('wellmarked')">Well-Marked</span> are nice tools for a rush deck.
        They can be used by both <span class="card" onclick="dC('nanaburuku')">Nana Buruku</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('fish')">Fish</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The deck does not have a lot of intercept, but plays
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('powerbasemontreal')">Powerbase: Montreal</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('rackthe')">The Rack</span> nonetheless, relying on the threat of
        a retaliation rush to protect them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just including a bit of <em>wakes</em> and some intercept enhancers like
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('catsguidance')">Cats' Guidance</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('sensethesavageway')">Sense the Savage Way</span>
        keep the other players guessing on wether the deck can block or not.
    </p>
    <p>
        Getting <span class="card" onclick="dC('widerview')">Wider View</span> at some point helps getting rid
        of the spurious <span class="card" onclick="dC('nanaburuku')">Nana Buruku</span> in crypt.
        She's also only played in 4 copies to avoid jamming the crypt too much; other minions are needed for the
        deck to work well.
    </p>
    <h2>Variants</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>Anarch</strong> variant uses
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('anarchconvert')">Anarch Convert</span> to make the vampires anarch,
        along
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('anarchrevolt')">Anarch Revolt</span> to improve pool damage,
        taking down any Anarch vampire on the prey side using rush actions.
        <a href="../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2018fnclf">Orian Gissler's deck</a> from the 2018 French NC
        is a good example.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Weenie ANI</strong> plays <i>i</i> without
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('nanaburuku')">Nana Buruku</span> nor
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('ashurtablets')">Ashur Tablets</span>.
        <a href="../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2016sncss">Kim Nilsson's deck</a> from the 2016 Swedish NC
        is a good example.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Toolbox</strong> variant includes more intercept, like
        <a href="../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2010hungarianecq">Ádám Horváth's deck</a> from 2010,
        with <span class="card" onclick="dC('aranthebestheimmortal')">Aranthebes, The Immortal</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('ravenspy')">Raven Spy</span>.
    </p>
    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Errata</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('pentextmsubversion')">Pentex™ Subversion</span>
            has been modified by an <em>errata</em> in September 2019.
            It does not prevent a vampire to act anymore, so it is less powerful
            and should probably not be included in the deck anymore.

        displayDeck({"author":"Matt Morgan, based on Martin Major's deck","comments":"It's rush combat with a strong master module. Master cards\nare the best in the game. I'd always rather have too many than too few.\nThe name is because the final was won 2-1-1-1 and Fish and Stick lead the\nway while Nana stayed hidden in my crypt. Fish is only in the deck to make\nit count as a Guruhi deck for TWDA purposes.\n\nOne might wonder why only 4 Nana when she's the star? The answer is that\nit's way better to have no Nana than all Nana. This deck needs a bunch of\nminion actions to succeed\n\nI really liked having AI here in the final, though I wound up not\nplaying it. Mbare Market probably isn't worth the slot. Should be a\n2nd Fame, I think. Otherwise the masters worked out very well.\n\nThe Entrancement and Well-Marked didn't really earn their keep at any\npoint, though Well-Marked is typically a free action at least. I play\nfewer Deep Songs than Martin's version because I'm not trying to rush\nwith every minion with every action. I bleed for 1 a little or stay up.\nI want my prey to go forward. I don't want to simply squish him. Coming\nout of the gate too fast is a mistake.\n\nVery few reactions. Sense the Savage Way should probably go since only\nNana can play them. I had multiple situations where I would have liked to\nblock with somebody else but couldn't because of the restriction on that\ncard. Getting to 2 intercept is nice, but it isn't worth the cost.\n\nVery consistent. Not a lot can survive repeated hits from this. Of course\nit's not fun to run into other ANI decks, but them's the breaks.\n","crypt":{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":4,"id":"201035","name":"Nana Buruku"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"200468","name":"Fish"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"200185","name":"Beetleman"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"200211","name":"Bobby Lemon"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"200353","name":"Dolie"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"201318","name":"Stick"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"201014","name":"Mouse"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"201507","name":"Zip"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"200839","name":"Lisa Noble"}],"count":12},"date":"2011-06-25","event":"NAC 2011 Day 2","library":{"cards":[{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":9,"id":"100106","name":"Ashur Tablets"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"100070","name":"Animalism"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"100199","name":"Blood Doll"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"102121","name":"Villein"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100085","name":"Archon Investigation"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100698","name":"Fame"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100824","name":"Giant's Blood"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101189","name":"Mbare Market, Harare"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101384","name":"Pentex(TM) Subversion"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101436","name":"Powerbase: Luanda"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101439","name":"Powerbase: Montreal"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101536","name":"The Rack"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"102180","name":"Wider View"}],"count":24,"type":"Master"},{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":10,"id":"100515","name":"Deep Song"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100652","name":"Entrancement"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"102172","name":"Well-Marked"}],"count":12,"type":"Action"},{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":13,"id":"100301","name":"Carrion Crows"},{"comments":null,"count":11,"id":"100029","name":"Aid from Bats"},{"comments":null,"count":4,"id":"101945","name":"Taste of Vitae"},{"comments":null,"count":3,"id":"101942","name":"Target Vitals"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100290","name":"Canine Horde"}],"count":32,"type":"Combat"},{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"100308","name":"Cats' Guidance"},{"comments":null,"count":2,"id":"101717","name":"Sense the Savage Way"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100519","name":"Delaying Tactics"},{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101321","name":"On the Qui Vive"}],"count":6,"type":"Reaction"},{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"101014","name":"Ivory Bow"}],"count":1,"type":"Equipment"},{"cards":[{"comments":null,"count":1,"id":"100581","name":"Dragonbound"}],"count":1,"type":"Event"}],"count":76},"name":"Salmon Fishstick","place":"Columbus, Ohio","player":"Matt Morgan","players_count":25,"score":null,"tournament_format":"3R+F","twda_id":"2011NACd2"})
