    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        This is a <em>allies toolbox</em> deck using
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('emeraldlegionnaire')">Emerald Legionnaire</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This version uses <span class="card" onclick="dC('erlik')">Erlik</span> as a star: his ability
        let the player get another Harbinger out fast and cheap. The fact that he has <i>C</i> let him use
        the excellent <span class="card" onclick="dC('forcedmarch')">Forced March</span> for stealth and unlock.
    </p>
    <p>
        The idea is to defend and get an
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('emeraldlegionnaire')">Emerald Legionnaire</span> out,
        then bring the others back from the ash heap if they are there.
        Once <span class="card" onclick="dC('unmaskingthe')">The Unmasking</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('fbispecialaffairsdivision')">FBI Special Affairs Division</span>
        hit the table, they're a solid defence.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('liquidation')">Liquidation</span> is used to bloat and can put some
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('emeraldlegionnaire')">Emerald Legionnaire</span> but also the cards
        to power their ability in the ash heap.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the game progresses,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('emeraldlegionnaire')">Emerald Legionnaire</span> are used to bleed.
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('vengefulspirit')">Vengeful Spirit</span> helps to boost
        the Harbinger bleeds, too.
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('inevitabilityofthevoid')">Inevitability of the Void</span> is used to lunge.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
    <p>
        To be able to use their ability,
        an <span class="card" onclick="dC('emeraldlegionnaire')">Emerald Legionnaire</span> must be put into play
        by recruiting it: the ones in the ash heap can not have their effect used — their card text is ignored as long
        as they are in the ash heap. In order to manage to get at least one into play, the deck packs quite a bit of
        stealth, and uses recruitment specialized modifiers like
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('shroudmastery')">Shroud Mastery</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('breathofthanatos')">Breath of Thanatos</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A key feature of this deck is the versatility of its cards:
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('spectraldivination')">Spectral Divination</span> can be used for stealth or
        intercept,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('breathofthanatos')">Breath of Thanatos</span> for stealth or a deadly strike,
        and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        The deck has quite a bit of intercept, but nothing close to what a <em>wall</em> construct can display.
        It will be happy enough to redirect the bleed with <i>A</i> bounces if given the chance.
    </p>
    <h2>Variants</h2>
    <p>
        A variant uses <span class="card" onclick="dC('capuchinthe')">The Capuchin</span> as star,
        <a href="../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2019gbzzc">Richard Stefan Utner's deck</a> from 2019
        is a good example of it.
    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Errata</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('pentextmsubversion')">Pentex™ Subversion</span>
            has been modified by an <em>errata</em> in September 2019.
            It does not prevent a vampire to act anymore, so it is less powerful
            and should probably not be included in the deck anymore.
