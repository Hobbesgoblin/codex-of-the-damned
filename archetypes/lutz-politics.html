    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        This is a <em>stealth bleed & vote</em> deck starring
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('unmada')">Unmada</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('lutzvonhohenzollern')">Lutz von Hohenzollern</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('undele')">Undele</span>.
        It uses <span class="card" onclick="dC('zillahsvalley')">Zillah's Valley</span>
        to get these big capacity vampires in play quickly, then
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('parityshift')">Parity Shift</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('villein')">Villein</span> to get some pool back.
    </p>
    <p>
        The sheer number of votes the vampire have makes sure they get the vote lock around the table.
        Stealth is high, with 16 stealth modifiers, and allows the vampire to bleed and vote safely.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('mentalmaze')">Mental Maze</span> is used to defend against rush actions
        and <span class="card" onclick="dC('telepathicmisdirection')">Telepathic Misdirection</span>
        against too powerful bleeds.
    </p>
    <p>
        The deck is slow but sturdy and applies constant high pressure to its prey.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('votercaptivation')">Voter Captivation</span> is used to get pool back on the
        vampires after <span class="card" onclick="dC('villein')">Villein</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('banishment')">Banishment</span> is used to get rid of cumbersome vampires.
        It can either weaken the prey, slow down the predator, or even be used cross table to maintain
        the table balance if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        The deck is deliberately compact with only 70 cards.
        This enhances the chances to get the many cards that are played in only one copy.
        As the game progresses, <span class="card" onclick="dC('undele')">Undele</span>'s ability
        can be used for recursion, getting the cards most adapted to the table context back in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many Master cards cost quite a bit of pool, but this is in fact a feature of the deck: this allows the
        player to get its own pool down in order to be able to play a
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('parityshift')">Parity Shift</span> on his prey.
    </p>
    <h2>Creator Insights</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Maxime Socroun</em> was kind enough to provide the following insights:
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the <em>errata</em> on <span class="card" onclick="dC('parityshift')">Parity Shift</span>,
        I feel like this version of the deck is not playable anymore and it drives me crazy.
    </p>
    <p>
        There may still be a way to make the <strong>Maris Lutz</strong> variant work, though.
    </p>
    <h2>Variants</h2>
    <p>
        Replacing <span class="card" onclick="dC('rafaeldecorazon')">Rafael de Corazon</span>
        by a second <span class="card" onclick="dC('dmitrailyanova')">Dmitra Ilyanova</span>
        allows for the inclusion of
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('forcedmarch')">Forced March</span> as she,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('unmada')">Unmada</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('undele')">Undele</span> can use it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Maris Lutz</strong> variant uses a group 3-4 crypt with
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('marisstreck')">Maris Streck</span>, like
        <a href="../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2016eclvgi">Danilo Torrisi's deck</a> from the 2016 EC.
        Using more Malkavian in the crypt makes
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('madnessnetwork')">Madness Network</span> a useful inclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>Helicopter</strong> variant uses the <span class="card" onclick="dC('alastor')">Alastor</span> +
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('helicopter')">Helicopter</span> combination to enable
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('lutzvonhohenzollern')">Lutz</span> to vote <em>and</em> bleed in the same turn,
        like in <a href="../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2014ecfcqmg">Fabien Garcia's deck</a> from 2014 EC FCQ.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>AD&D</strong> variant uses
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('derange')">Derange</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('malkaviandementia')">Malkavian Dementia</span>,
        like <a href="../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2010finnishecq">Otso Saariluoma's deck</a> from 2010.
        This combination can steal any vampire, robbing them of their blood and equipment using
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('heidelbergcastlegermany')">Heidelberg Castle, Germany</span>,
        or even destroying them for pool with
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('golcondainnerpeace')">Golconda: Inner Peace</span>,
        provided one can get a second Master Action with
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('cybele')">Cybele</span> or
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('parthenonthe')">The Parthenon</span>.
    </p>
    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Errata</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('pentextmsubversion')">Pentex™ Subversion</span>
            has been modified by an <em>errata</em> in September 2019.
            It does not prevent a vampire to act anymore, so it is less powerful
            and should maybe not be included in the deck anymore.
            Still its ability to disable a strong blocker is useful for the lunge.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('parityshift')">Parity Shift</span>
            has also been modified in the September 2019 <em>errata</em>.
            The amount of pool is no longer equal to the number of Methusalah, but is stable at 3.
            The card is then less powerful in the game beginning, and should maybe be included in less copies.
