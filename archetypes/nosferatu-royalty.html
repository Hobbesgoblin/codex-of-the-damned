    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck using Nosferatu <em>Princes</em> and <em>Justicar</em>,
        and the <i>OI</i> disciplines. It has an efficient combat module using <i>I</i> classic
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('aidfrombats')">Aid from Bats</span> &
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('carrioncrows')">Carrion Crows</span> combination.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pool damage is done by using <span class="card" onclick="dC('deepsong')">Deep Song</span> to bleed,
        together with damage dealing votes and <span class="card" onclick="dC('fame')">Fame</span> if it is drawn.
        <i>O</i> provides good stealth, as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
        The deck has good intercept using a lot of
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('secondtraditiondomain')">Second Tradition: Domain</span>, together with
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('underbridgestray')">Underbridge Stray</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('ravenspy')">Raven Spy</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('cockrobin')">Cock Robin</span> is the star of the deck and his ability
        is used to the maximum, with <span class="card" onclick="dC('deepsong')">Deep Song</span> and <i>i</i>
        allies and retainers.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
    <p>
        <em>Maxime Socroun</em> indicates that <span class="card" onclick="dC('warsawstation')">Warsaw Station</span>
        is the most important card in the deck. Indeed its effect seconds
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('cockrobin')">Cock Robin</span>'s ability beautifully and provides a nice
        increase in <a href="../strategy/fundamentals.html#AB">A&B</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('scourgeoftheenochians')">Scourge of the Enochians</span> is a tactical
        counter against breed constructs, as they can quickly become overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the game progresses,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('tierofsouls')">Tier of Souls</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('enkilcog')">Enkil Cog</span> will improve bleeds.
        Moreover, <span class="card" onclick="dC('enkilcog')">Enkil Cog</span> will let
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('cockrobin')">Cock Robin</span> use his ability twice in successive turns
        and as <span class="card" onclick="dC('tierofsouls')">Tier of Souls</span> is an <i>i</i> action,
        it lets <span class="card" onclick="dC('cockrobin')">Cock Robin</span> unlock and bleed afterwards
        immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('deepsong')">Deep Song</span> can be used to bleed or to rush
        cumbersome vampires, depending on the context.
    </p>
    <p>
        The combat module is strong, but not the primary focus of the deck.
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('kevlarvest')">Kevlar Vest</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('heroicmight')">Heroic Might</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('preternaturalstrength')">Preternatural Strength</span> can come in handy
        against adverse combat modules.
    </p>
    <p>
        The deck does not include so many votes as it is really not sure about getting the vote lock on the table.
        Any dedicated political deck will get more votes than the 5-7 this one can put into play.
    </p>
    <h2>Variants</h2>
    <p>
        Variants include the use of a group 2 crypt and a <i>P</i> combat module, like in
        <a href="../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2k8czechnational">Gyula Erdõs's deck</a> from the 2008 Czech NC.
    </p>
    <p>
        More votes can also be used, alongside
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('fourthtraditiontheaccounting')">Fourth Tradition: The Accounting</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('groomingtheprotege')">Grooming the Protégé</span> for crypt acceleration
        to get more votes on the table,
        like in <a href="../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2k8spanishnatday2">Iñaki Jimenez's deck</a> from the 2008
        Spanish NC.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some variants even discard the combat side of things to focus on a full political deck, like in
        <a href="../deck-search/index.html?twda_id=2013qcfeelblpf">Pascal Bertrand's deck</a> from 2013,
        using <span class="card" onclick="dC('mentalmaze')">Mental Maze</span> instead.
        In this case, this makes some room for a
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('thirdtraditionprogeny')">Third Tradition: Progeny</span> plus
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('consanguineousboon')">Consanguineous Boon</span> combination
        to bloat and get more vampires (and more votes) out.
    </p>
    <div class="warning">
        <h3>Errata</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('pentextmsubversion')">Pentex™ Subversion</span>
            has been modified by an <em>errata</em> in September 2019.
            It does not prevent a vampire to act anymore, so it is less powerful and should probably
            not be included in the deck anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('villein')">Villein</span> has been modified by an errata in June 2018
            to limit the blood taken to a maximum of 5.
            Still they should always be as efficient as ever in this archetype.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('parityshift')">Parity Shift</span>
            has also been modified in the September 2019 <em>errata</em>.
            The amount of pool is no longer equal to the number of Methusalah, but is stable at 3.
            The card is then less powerful in the game beginning, but is still a good fit in this deck.
