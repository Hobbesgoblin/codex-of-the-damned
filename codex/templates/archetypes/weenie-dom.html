<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>weenie bleed</em> deck using the <i>d</i> discipline.
    The idea is to get as many low capacity vampires out as fast as possible,
    and bleed the preys one after the other as fast as possible.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Govern the Unaligned") }}
    combined with
    {{ card("Conditioning") }},
    {{ card("Seduction") }}, and
    {{ card("Command of the Beast") }}
    make for hard to block dreadful bleeds for 7.
</p>
<p>
    As the game progresses, some <i>D</i> bounce can be used to add to the damages
    if the predator becomes aggressive.
</p>
<p>
    The Master module uses {{ card("Dominate") }} to enhance the vampires,
    but also {{ card("The Parthenon") }} and
    {{ card("Ashur Tablets") }} for a bit of recursion.
    {{ card("Jake Washington") }},
    {{ card("Life in the City") }} and
    {{ card("Giant's Blood") }} are used to bring back some blood
    on the vampires.
</p>
<p>
    The combat modules uses only
    {{ card("Absorb the Mind") }} for defence. It is a bit weak,
    but <i>d</i> has nothing better to offer.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    Well-timed {{ card("Misdirection") }} and
    {{ card("Pentexâ„¢ Subversion") }} can help for the lunge.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The <strong>Agent of Power</strong> variant cuts the
    {{ card("Ashur Tablets") }}
    and uses {{ card("Agent of Power") }} to let more vampires
    use superior <i>D</i>, like in
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Manoel Pinheiro's deck"), twda_id="2014saclcqspb") }} from 2014
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Aim & Chain</strong> variant uses
    {{ card("Target Vitals") }} and
    {{ card("Zip Gun") }} with a bit of <i>f</i> prevention
    for the combat module, as in
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Vincent Ripoll's deck"), twda_id="2k9ecday1") }} from the 2009 EC Day 1.
