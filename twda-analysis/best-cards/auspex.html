        <p>
            <i>a</i> provides the best intercept in the game, plus the ability to bounce bleeds.
            It makes for an excellent defence.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">

            <h4>Telepathic Misdirection (632 decks)</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
            By far the most played card in <i>a</i>, it is an excellent bounce.
            Its blood cost is fair and its basic effect can still be useful
            if the table context does not mandate bounces.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            A +2 intercept bonus combined with a wake,
            basically a dream come true for all block-oriented constructs.
            The intercept can only apply to directed actions though,
            and it needs to be completed by classic intercept enhancers for a defence to be really effective.
            Blocking political actions, equip and recruit actions are critical to one’s defence.
        </p>

            <h4>My Enemy's Enemy (387 decks)</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
            Another intercept source, with the interesting bounce option at no cost.
            Even though a bounce to one’s ally is a hard bargain,
            with luck it can bounce a bleed back to its original prey.
        </p>

            <h4>Bowl of Convergence (351 decks)</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
            Almost systematically played in <i>a</i> decks, it is a solid permanent intercept at no cost.
        </p>

    <div class="column">

        </div>
        <p>
            Only two cards in the game allow the interception of cross table actions
            or actions directed to other players, this one and
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('falcons-eye')">Falcon's Eye</span>.
            This ability is precious as it may be the only defence against a grand-predator using political actions,
            but also as a way to control the table balance and avoid early ousts.
            Specifically, it allows blocking the prey bleeds, which can slow her done tremendously.
        </p>

    <div class="column">

            <img src="../../card-images/enhanced-senses.jpg">
            <h4>Enhanced Senses (285 decks)</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
            An efficient intercept enhancer.
            Other enhancers are welcome as the same reaction card can’t be played twice on a single action.
            Note that this makes an enhancer with a twist like
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('my-enemys-enemy')">My Enemy's Enemy</span> a valuable addition,
            compared to other enhancers with less useful effects like
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('precognition')">Precognition</span> or
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('spirits-touch')">Spirit's Touch</span>.

            <h4>Precognition (132 decks)</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
            An additional intercept enhancer, with a decent combat bonus at superior <i>A</i>.
            As reaching high scores of intercept requires stacking different reactions,
            it is used in constructs where more diversity is needed to achieve the desired intercept level.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <div class="column-image">
            <img src="../../card-images/spirits-touch.jpg">
            <h4>Spirit's Touch (121 decks)</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
            Yet another intercept enhancer, its optional maneuver at superior <i>A</i> can be useful
            in constructs using long range combat after the block.
            Yet not as efficient as other <i>a</i> reactions, it is used when additional intercept is needed.
