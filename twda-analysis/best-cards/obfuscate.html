            This block denial modifier comes in very handy against a single minion.
            It works against all minions and vampires and can bypass even high levels of stacked intercept.

        </div>
        <p>
            A single unlocked minion can be hard to get around if multiple actions are in order.
            This is an excellent tool in this case as it lets you lock the defending minion on the first block failure.
            Furthermore, it will work as a block denial against allies.

        <p>
            Decks with an actual combat module along <i>o</i> include it because of its versatility.
            Controlling the range is always an issue and the maneuver option comes in handy.
            Even with a thin combat module, going to long range can still be useful to avoid some damage.

        </div>
        <p>
            An additional source of stealth that becomes an excellent tool when not all vampires have <i>o</i>.
            It can also be stacked, by the vampire doing the action himself, then by another vampire with <i>O</i>.
        </p>

    <div class="column">
        <div class="column-image">
            <img src="../../card-images/spying-mission.jpg"/>
            <h4>Spying Mission (247 decks)</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
            An additional stealth modifier that can be stacked over more widespread ones,
            it is also a decent counter against bounces: it allows one to suppress a high damage bleed
            that has been redirected to its grand-prey, which is actually quite a common situation.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <div class="column-image">
            <img src="../../card-images/forgotten-labyrinth.jpg"/>
            <h4>Forgotten Labyrinth (229 decks)</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
            Especially useful in decks with a political module, it gives such a high bonus to undirected actions
            that they become virtually unblockable.
            Its uselessness for directed actions still makes it absent from a lot of <i>o</i> modules.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
        <div class="column-image">
            <img src="../../card-images/veil-the-legions.jpg"/>
            <h4>Veil the Legions (193 decks)</h4>
        </div>
        <p>
            Less widely used than <span class="card" onclick="dC('cloak-the-gathering')">Cloak the Gathering</span>
            because it offers no direct stealth on an action, its efficiency increases in decks
            with more low capacity vampires like weenie or swarm constructs.
            A vampire with <i>O</i> can give +1 stealth to multiple consecutive bleeds, a nice setup for a lunge move.
