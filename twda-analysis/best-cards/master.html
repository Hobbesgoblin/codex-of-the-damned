        <p>
            Before its <em>errata</em> in september 2019, <em>Pentex</em> was played in over half of tournament decks
            and it was the most played card overall. It used to prevent the target minion from acting too,
            and that made it the most versatile card of the game.
            In the endgame its power is still worthwhile though: disabling a specific minion on the prey side
            can be key to victory, especially for decks that do not include a lot of stealth.

            Loved for its ubiquitousness, the <em>Dreams</em> provides either two pool
            (and can even accelerate your setup if played in the beginning) or help the deck rotation
            in critical moments by giving a two cards rotation.

            <span class="card" onclick="dC('golconda-inner-peace')">Golconda: Inner Peace</span>.
            It is often played in a single exemplary: with a bit of luck it brings a definitive advantage,

            it is the most used leech cards. Both enable a 1 point leech per turn,

            which can be key to avoid hunts and keep one’s <a href="../../strategy/fundamentals.html#ABC">ABC</a> high.
            Compared to <span class="card" onclick="dC('blood-doll')">Blood Doll</span>, its cost is higher
            (it takes a full turn to kick in and costs 1 pool,

            but it is more secure as it cannot be destroyed and, more importantly, it is a <em>Trifle</em>:

            The <em>errata</em> made <span class="card" onclick="dC('minion-tap')">Minion Tap</span> relevant again,

            An excellent device for combat-oriented decks. Broader than a rush action like
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('bums-rush')">Bum's Rush</span>, it lets all the minions rush the target.
            This is a good way to quickly overwhelm a "Strike: combat ends" defensive module, plus it will take
            an action to remove, slowing the opponent even more.

            An excellent bloat device, it helps to get multiple big capacity vampires out at a reasonnable cost.
            Even better with crypt accelerators like
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('zillahs-valley')">Zillah's Valley</span> and
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('information-highway')">Information Highway</span>,
            it has long been outclassed by <span class="card" onclick="dC('villein')">Villein</span>,
            until the <em>errata</em> of 2018 setting an upper limit of 5 blood on it.
            Now both options have their pro and cons and <em>Minion Tap</em> makes a comeback.

        <p>
            An excellent bloat device, its side-effect of card discard can be a bummer, as many
            decks rely on the fact that even just 2 exemplaries of a given card are enough to draw it at some point
            in the game. However, used in conjunction with
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('ashur-tablets')">Ashur Tablets</span>,
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('emerald-legionnaire')">Emerald Legionnaire</span> or
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('sudario-refraction')">Sudario Refraction</span>, it becomes unvaluable.
