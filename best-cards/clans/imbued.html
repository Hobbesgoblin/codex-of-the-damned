    <h1><img src="../../icons/creed-visionary.svg"> Imbued</h1>
    <p>
        The Imbued have a special place in the game: they are not vampires, but mortal allies.
        They are organised in creeds instead of clans, and have virtues instead of disciplines.
        Their bizarre handling and specific ruleset makes them unique, and they have given birth to
        their own <a href="../../archetypes/hunters.html">Hunters</a> archetype.
    </p>
    <p>
        When they come into play, Imbued can get a <em>Conviction</em> card straight from the library.
        Moreover, the can get an additional one each turn during the unlock phase, from the ash heap or the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
        They also have a unique access to <em>Powers</em>, which they can get as a +1 stealth undirected action.
        If the action to get a <em>Power</em> succeeds, they unlock.
    </p>
    <h2>Highlights</h2>

        </div>
        <p>
            The most played <em>Conviction</em>. Usually all three <em>Conviction</em> cards are played in imbued decks,
            but <span class="card" onclick="dC('beatriceoracle171tremblay')">Béatrice</span> is often added
            to vampire crypts for additional bleed, and all she really needs is this <em>Conviction</em> for a bit of stealth.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is usually the first <em>Conviction</em> any Imbued fetches when he comes into play,
            as it protects them against anti-ally actions like
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('entrancement')">Entrancement</span>.

        <p>
            An excellent <em>Conviction</em> that boosts combat or bleed depending on the need.
            As it is a <em>Conviction</em>, it can be used every turn and come back into play during the unlock phase.

        <p>
            A good bleeding minion for just 3 pool, she gets included in vampire crypts to help with the bleed,
            as her ability makes her impractical in Imbued crypts.
            Helped by a <span class="card" onclick="dC('secondsight')">Second Sight</span> for stealth,
            she becomes an interesting minion.

            Her ability is the cornerstone of most Imbued decks.
            Not only can the Imbued come back from Incapacity (their version of torpor) with only
            two <em>Convictions</em> instead of three, they can also do so during any turn.
            As Imbued are fragile, this additional protection is welcome.

            A versatile out-of-turn Master. It can be used as a wake, but also as a way to bring equipment into play
            without being blocked. As Imbued do not get so much stealth, this is a real asset to gear them up.

            His virtues are useful and his ability is an excellent bloat device,

            Good virtues for a decent price, his ability is also quite nice as it deters rush actions against him.

            Jewel of the <em>Justice</em> virtue, the combination of <em>drive</em> and <em>wake</em> effects

            Second excellent <em>Justice</em> power after <span class="card" onclick="dC('vigilance')">Vigilance</span>,
            it explains why the <em>Justice</em> virtue is the most played among Imbued.
            Combined with <span class="card" onclick="dC('unmaskingthe')">The Unmasking</span>, it transforms
            the Imbued in excellent blockers.

            This regeneration ability makes any Imbued with the <em>Defense</em> virtue quite sturdy.
            As Imbued can not hunt, this is one of the few ways they can get some life back.

            <span class="card" onclick="dC('jenniecassie247orne')">Jennie</span> has the <em>Visionary</em> virtue.
            It can also be used to cancel an action on the prey side, so it is very versatile.

        <p>
            Another good <em>Defense</em> power, as it can be used to "block" bleeds
            without even needing intercept. The <em>Conviction</em> cost is a bit high,
            but the threat of it alone can slow down an aggressive predator.
