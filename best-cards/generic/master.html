        <p>
            Before its <em>errata</em> in september 2019, <em>Pentex</em> was played in over half of tournament decks
            and it was the most played card overall. It used to prevent the target minion from acting too,
            and that made it the most versatile card of the game.
            In the endgame its power is still worthwhile though: disabling a specific minion of the prey
            can be key to victory.

        <p>
            Loved for its ubiquitousness, the <em>Dreams</em> provides either two pool
            (and can even accelerate the setup if played early) or help the deck rotation
            in critical moments by drawing two cards.

            <span class="card" onclick="dC('golcondainnerpeace')">Golconda: Inner Peace</span>.

            it is similar to <span class="card" onclick="dC('blooddoll')">Blood Doll</span>.
            Both enable a 1 point leech per turn and allow to give some blood back to a thirsty vampire,
            which can avoid hunt acions and keep <a href="../../strategy/fundamentals.html#ABC">ABC</a> high.
            Compared to <span class="card" onclick="dC('blooddoll')">Blood Doll</span>, its cost is higher:
            it takes a full turn to kick in and costs 1 pool, making it 2 pool less efficient,
            but it cannot be destroyed and is a <em>Trifle</em>.

            Before its <em>errata</em> in 2018, it permitted to take back as much blood as desired
            from the target vampire with no upper limit. Its <em>Trifle</em> trait made it one of the best leech option,
            besting the <span class="card" onclick="dC('miniontap')">Minion Tap</span>.
            The <em>errata</em> made <span class="card" onclick="dC('miniontap')">Minion Tap</span> relevant again,
            so no doubt the play count between the two cards will evolve accordingly.

            The ability to cancel any minion card is extremely valuable.
            The 1 pool cost ensures it cannot be abused, but keeping it in hand

            An excellent crypt accelerator at no cost, it is played both with big capacity crypts, but also with

            it becomes tremendously efficient. Decks that use it typically include a dozen of them,

            An excellent bloat device, it helps to get multiple big capacity vampires out at a reasonnable cost.
            Even better with crypt accelerators like
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('zillahsvalley')">Zillah's Valley</span> and
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('informationhighway')">Information Highway</span>,
            it has long been outclassed by <span class="card" onclick="dC('villein')">Villein</span>,
            until the <em>errata</em> of 2018 setting an upper limit of 5 blood on it.

        <p>
            An excellent bloat device, its side-effect of card discard can be a bummer, as many
            decks rely on the fact that even just 2 exemplaries of a given card are enough to draw it at some point
            in the game. However, used in conjunction with
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('ashurtablets')">Ashur Tablets</span>,
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('emeraldlegionnaire')">Emerald Legionnaire</span> or
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('sudariorefraction')">Sudario Refraction</span>, it becomes unvaluable.
