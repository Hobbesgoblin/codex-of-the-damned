            Wake reaction cards are played in most decks.
            This one has no requirement, no cost and is immediately replaced, plus it can be used by allies.
            However, it may need to be complemented by other wakes because of its once per turn limit.

            A very widespread defence against political actions.
            The action can still be performed again a turn later, but breaking a predator's lunge
            or preventing a prey's <span class="card" onclick="dC('consanguineousboon')">Consanguineous Boon</span>
            can make a win. It is best used <em>after</em> the vote has taken place.

        <p>
            A cheap way to ensure an optimal card rotation throughout the game.
            It has no direct effect on the table so it is often overlooked,
            even though the fluidity it confers is often key to victory.

        <p>
            By far the most played ally of the game, he is an excellent blocker for a cheap price.
            An excellent addition in virtually any deck. Its combat ability makes him quite hard to take down
            and his existence alone is a deterrent to diablery, as he can be put into play to destroy the diabolist
            the next turn.

        <p>
            An excellent tool for bloating, it is often seen in rush decks.
            Played efficiently, it helps leech with cards like
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('miniontap')">Minion Tap</span> or

            It provides a deadly aggravated strike at any range for just one pool
            and is therefore the most cost-effective weapon of the game.
            Any deck expecting actual combat can play it.

        <p>
            Although only usable by a vampire and not replaced until the next turn, it has the advantage
            to be playable multiple times, so it is a good complement to the more common
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('onthequivive')">On the Qui Vive</span>.

            Yet another wake, this one is replaced but can cost a bit of blood.
            It can be a good complement or alternative to
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('onthequivive')">On the Qui Vive</span> and

            A cheap permanent intercept device, although affecting only the predator.
            As a bonus, it can have a devastative effect against weenie constructs.

        <p>
            A key card to ally-oriented decks, it transforms any ally setup into a very cumbersome wall.
            An overall intercept bonus at no cost is already good,
            plus being an event makes it hard to remove from the table.

        <p>
            A permanent bleed boost at no cost only available for big capacity vampires,
            it also allows acting during other players turns:
            add the end of the predator turn to stay unlocked, or during the prey turn to bleed strong while
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('archoninvestigation')">Archon Investigation</span> can not be played
            (as it is an out-of-turn).
            With a way to unlock the vampire, it can let a minion bleed in consecutive turns.

            Only available for Princes and Justicars, it is one of the most effective wake of the game.
            Not only does it unlock — not just wake — the vampire, it also provides a solid +2 intercept bonus.
            Furthermore, the reasonable blood cost of one is only paid when the unlock effect is needed.

            An excellent combat option, it usually gets through against deck with no heavy combat module.
            A single aggravated damage can even become three and burn a vampire.
            Because any minion can use it, it is also included in ally oriented decks.

        <p>
            Played in decks with non-Camarilla big capacity vampires,
            it is a straight-up boost in <a href="../../strategy/fundamentals.html#ABC">ABC</a> for just one pool.
            Hard to block and hard to destroy in combat, he is safe in many situations.

            The optional maneuver make it a cost-efficient option when it comes to ranged weapons.
            It is often combined with <i>c</i> for maximum efficiency as it is not limited
            to a single strike per round or combat: additional strikes transform
            this nice weapon into a real tool of destruction.

            A good tool for pool damage for combat-oriented decks.
            The hand size diminution is totally acceptable if it means dealing 2 or 3 damages per turn to the prey.

            He is a good rusher open to all decks. Hard to block, he can pick his targets for maximum effects.
            Starting with 4 life, he often goes up to more.
            His ability lets him dispose of young vampire without good defensive options:
            a little pricey to be just a buffer in front of a rush deck,
            he becomes invaluable against weenie decks.

            Although not a minion card, it deserves its place here as it is accessible to all decks.
            It is the most common option to efficiently convert vampires to the Anarch sect.

        <p>
            A death sentence for breed decks at no cost, it is often included in slow decks that have difficulties to cope
            with the overwhelming numbers of decks creating newborn vampires with cards like
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('embracethe')">The Embrace</span>.

            An excellent intercept enhancer that does not even cost an action,

            An excellent option for decks with good intercept capabilities, it makes blocks more threatening
            and keep closed combat constructs at range,
            improving the <a href="../../strategy/combat.html#bruise">bruise</a> ratio of the deck substantially.

            The eponymous card of <em>rush</em> decks, it allows for direct combat against any minion,
            with the nice bonus of a maneuver to control the range a bit.
            Some disciplines have better alternatives, like <i>i</i> with
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('deepsong')">Deep Song</span>, but otherwise it is a go-to card

        <p>
            An efficient weapon at no cost, requiring no action to equip, it is a good alternative for
            toolbox decks not so much specialized in combat. Often played in association with <i>f</i>
            for damage prevention.
