                    It has no direct effect on the table so it is often overlooked,

                    By far the most played ally of the game, he is an excellent blocker for a cheap price.
                    An excellent addition in virtually any deck. Its combat ability makes him quite hard to take down
                    and his existence alone is a deterrent to diablery, as he can be put into play to destroy the
                    diabolist

                    it also allows acting during other players turns:
                    add the end of the predator turn to stay unlocked, or during the prey turn to bleed strong while

                    The eponymous card of <em>rush</em> decks, it allows for direct combat against any minion,
                    with the nice bonus of a maneuver to control the range a bit.
                    Some disciplines have better alternatives, like <i>i</i> with
                    <span class="card" onclick="dC('deepsong')">Deep Song</span>, but otherwise it is a go-to card
                    for combat greedy minions.

                    An efficient weapon at no cost, requiring no action to equip, it is a good alternative for
                    toolbox decks not so much specialized in combat. Often played in association with <i>f</i>
                    for damage prevention.
