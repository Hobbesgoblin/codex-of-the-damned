    <h1 id="deck-building">Deck building</h1>
    <h2 id="modules-and-density">Modules and density</h2>
    <p>
        Decks can be broken down in « modules »: group of cards with a similar objective.
        The percentage of cards each module contains is its density. As the normal hand size is seven,
        the expectation (<em>ie.</em> the number of cards of the module you can expect in any given hand)
        is the density time seven.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Spam</strong> modules have a density over 25% entail an expectation over 1.75: more often than not,
        two cards of the module in hand. This is a rare distribution,
        but necessary to continuously play a given card multiple times every turn.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Strong</strong> modules have a density between 14% and 25% and an expectation between 1 and 1.5:
        these cards will be used once or twice at each turn.
        Most decks have one or multiple strong modules, and their strategy can often be identified by checking them.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Standard</strong> modules have a density between 7% and 14% have an expectation between ½ and 1.
        They are supposed to be used regularly but not necessarily every turn. Strong and standard modules cards
        can be discarded when needed, as one can be confident to get another in hand quite soon.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Tactical</strong> modules have a density below 7% and typically provide specific support.
        From unique permanents and events to counters or responses to expected counters, they provide build-up power
        and security. As these cards are drawn sporadically, they are meant to be kept in hand for special cases
        or immediately discarded if the context is not favourable. In case they might come in handy, they should be
        kept in hand until needed: the sparse distribution of the module makes sure the cards will not jam the hand.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
        <h3>Master module</h3>
        <p>
            The Master module density depends on the rotation speed: one want to play one Master card per turn
            as much as possible, but not more. So the higher the rotation speed, the slimmer the master module density.
            Hence, the Master cards count stays stable across deck sizes: 12 to 15 Master cards plus, optionally,
            up to 6 or 7 Trifle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some decks can use specific cards like <span class="card" onclick="dC('parthenonthe')">The Parthenon</span>
            to get more Master actions and hence play more Master cards in the deck, though:
            this is the
            <strong>M</strong>ulti <strong>M</strong>aster <strong>P</strong>hase <strong>A</strong>ctions (MMPA)
            strategy.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="rotation">Rotation</h2>
    <p>
        Games usually last between 10 to 20 turns and decks are tailored with the peak card rotation speed in mind:
        the number of cards played on average between one unlock phase and the next,
        not counting the few first turns of build-up. The deck size should enable a peak rotation during 12 turns.
        The efficiency of a deck depends on its capacity to maintain an optimal rotation speed throughout the game:
        being stuck with no relevant card to play is a loosing situation.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
        <h3>Deck size examples</h3>
        <p>
            60 cards deck have a peak rotation of 5 cards maximum (5 × 12 = 60): in the mid-game it plays one master,
            three to four minion cards, and maybe a discard. This counts the whole turn, reactions included.
        </p>
        <p>
            90 cards deck have a peak rotation of 7 to 8 cards (90 ∕ 12 = 7.5): in the mid-game it plays one master,
            up to a full hand of minion cards and maybe a discard.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        <strong>Cycling</strong> cards and purposefully increasing the rotation to get more efficient cards
        is sometimes the only way to keep the rotation fluid.
        Multiple cards are available to provide good cycling options:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="card" onclick="dC('dreamsofthesphinx')">Dreams of the Sphinx</li>
        <li class="card" onclick="dC('barrensthe')">The Barrens</li>
        <li class="card" onclick="dC('heartofnizchetus')">Heart of Nizchetus</li>
        <li>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('fragmentofthebookofnod')">Fragment of the Book of Nod</span>
            (need to be defended)
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('powerbaselosangeles')">Powerbase: Los Angeles</span>
            (need to be defended, best with Anarchs)
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('admonitionsthe')">The Admonitions</span>
            (Sabbat only, best with Black Hand)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A card that is hard to play can <strong>jam</strong> the hand.
        Action modifiers, especially restricted stealth cards like
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('forgottenlabyrinth')">Forgotten Labyrinth</span>,
        can only be used when the opponent tries to block, so they can jam.
        On the other hand, action cards like
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('computerhacking')">Computer Hacking</span>
        do not usually jam the hand as they can be played as soon as a minion is unlocked and ready to act.
        A tactical module for card rotation can be played in situations when jamming is expected.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
        <h3>Recursion</h3>
        <p>
            Even stronger than a good rotation, the <strong>recursion</strong> can be a strong point in a deck:
            it is the ability to fetch cards from the ash heap and get them back into hand.
            Only a few cards provide recursion:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span class="card" onclick="dC('ashurtablets')">Ashur Tablets</span> provide an excellent
                recursion as well as a powerful bloat. They need more than one Master phase action to be really
                effective, so <span class="card" onclick="dC('parthenonthe')">The Parthenon</span> can come in
                handy. The MMPA archetypes like
                <a href="../archetypes/girls-will-find-inner-circles.html">Girls Will Find Inner Circles</a>
                make full use of this card.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="card" onclick="dC('sargonfragmentthe')">The Sargon Fragment</span> is the only
                other option open to all, but it is unique and uses up a lot of actions.
            <li>
                <img src="../icons/clan-giovanni.svg"> have the excellent
                <span class="card" onclick="dC('sudariorefraction')">Sudario Refraction</span> and the lesser
                <span class="card" onclick="dC('spiritualguidance')">Spiritual Guidance</span>
            </li>

                <span class="card" onclick="dC('gearup')">Gear Up</span> (Anarchs)
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="card" onclick="dC('garibaldimeuccimuseum')">Garibaldi-Meucci Museum</span>
                (Unique, Anarchs)
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="card" onclick="dC('droppointnetwork')">Drop Point Network</span>
                (Black Hand)
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="card" onclick="dC('maabara')">Maabara</span> (<img src="../icons/clan-harbingers.svg">)
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="card" onclick="dC('unity')">Unity</span>
                (<img src="../icons/creed-visionary.svg">)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Beyond its obious advantage of fetching just the right card at the right time, a good recursion allows
            a deck to adapt itself to the context and the table situation.
