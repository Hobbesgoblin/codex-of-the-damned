    <h1 id="bloat">Table talk</h1>
    <em>« Table talk »</em> is an important part of the game.
    The best players are ruthless negotiators and rely on their skill to topple the game in their favour.
    <h2 id="negociation">Negociation</h2>
    <p>
        Making tactical deals with other players during the game is a necessity and the heart of table talk.
        Asking someone to block and action or let it pass through, to rush a vampire or let it live, is easy enough.
        In fact, a lot of things can be discussed and negociated around the table. The key to successful negociation
        is to determine what every other player <strong>can offer</strong> and what he <strong>may desire</strong>.
        Once one gets the hang of it, almost anything can be dealt on a table.
    </p>
    <p>Some tactical deals are fairly common:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Agreeing for a low damage combat (1 damage each) before blocking an ally bleed being bounced.</li>
        <li>Getting another player's vampire out of torpor — as it is a directed action, it is harder to block.</li>
        <li>Letting an action get through — often on the ground that the result does not hinder the other player.</li>
        <li>
            Aggreing to use <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('ashur-tablets')">Ashur Tablets</span>
            alternatively when two players use them, thus avoiding to cripple one another.
        </li>
        <li>Asking for help to get a vampire down by getting into combat.</li>
        <li>Letting an ally borrow a card like
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('the-rack')">The Rack</span> or
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('powerbase-montreal')">Powerbase: Montreal</span>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Deals can tend to something <em>not</em> being done instead of something being offered.
        Dealing to <em>not</em> bleed, <em>not</em> block or <em>not</em> rush are valid and often offered to
        one's prey or predator.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
        <h3 class="tip-title">The unbearable lightness of deals</h3>
        <p>
            They are two important things to keep in mind with deals: first, they can always be broken, and one should
            always be prepared to break them or have them broken by the other party. Second, one can always deal
            something he can not do anyway. For example, a wall deck can well deal to let an action pass
            in exchange for some advantage, even if he had no way to block the action in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deals are a powerful tool but they should still be considered with some lightness.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Finally, on the tournament scene, <strong>table splits</strong> deals are commonplace. For this kind of deals,
        2 or 3 prominent players agree upon a repartition of Victory Points by deciding who gets to oust who.
        This is often key for a good cross table alliance.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Information, Deception and Standing
    </h2>
    <p>
        Table talk is not only about negociation, it is also about manipulation.
        Multiple techniques are used for deception and information gathering. One such technique is to
        <strong>announce</strong> every action one as the intention to undertake before playing it.
        It has multiple interesting effects:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            It is a nice way to <strong>gather information</strong> about the opponents play:
            can they block, bounce or counter?
        </li>
        <li>
            It opens a window of negociation to get an action through and <strong>avoid possible blocks</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            It makes the player <strong>appear more affable</strong> and less threatening, as he looks like he tries
            to get other players aproval before deciding on his action. Keeping that in mind, it is a good play
            to accept to delay an action if it causes an issue for an ally, or to excuse oneself when undertaking
            an aggressive action toward another player. Being likeable is an excellent asset throughout the game.
        </li>
        <li>
            It gives an occasion to use a bit of deception by commenting the action and
            <strong>mislead the opponents</strong> about its long term effect or importance to the deck strategy.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div class="tip">
        <h3 class="tip-title">Decision timing</h3>
        <p>
            The time someone takes to ponder wether or not they react to a play or an action can be an indication
            of their hand content. One should keep focused on the decision timing of the other players,
            while trying to be as unconspicuous as possible oneself.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The best but hardest way to be impenetrable is to be focused enough to always take a similar short
                time pondering any reaction — even when none is possible. This is easier said than done,
                but this is what the real <strong>Poker Face</strong> is about.
            </li>
            <li>
                An easier way to go is to <strong>act as if</strong> one had a wake or a bounce in hand when it's not
                the case and as if one has none when in fact one has, from time to time.
                Asking for two seconds to ponder during another player turn to hint at a counter like
                <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('sudden-reversal')">Sudden Reversal</span> without having it in
                hand is a cheap but effective move. Even better if the card is not in the deck at all: hinting
                at a card one does not have only to draw it the next turn is quite clumsy.
            </li>
            <li>
                The easiest way to stay composed is to <strong>decide in advance</strong> what one's reaction will be.
                For example, with a wake in hand, one can decide <em>beforehand</em> that one will wake only on a bleed
                if it is anounced above one pool. This way, when an action is announced,
                on can always react quite fast — the pondering time does not show as the decision is already made.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
        The last tool of manipulation one can wield easily is about <strong>standing</strong> around the table.
        A handful of casual comments can go a long way. One can always try to give the impression that:
    </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                One is in a good position to handle one's prey and she will die quickly. This way one appear as a
                valuable ally and can make the prey natural allies hesitant about helping her.
            </li>
            <li>
                One's predator is an unsustainable threat. This will encourage the rest of the table to focus
                on him, hopefully releaving a bit of the pressure he projects.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        This <strong>posture</strong> is a default — but effective — one:
        <em>"My prey is doomed but my predator will handle me single-handedly"</em>.
        This should be adapted, however, depending on the archetypes around the table. The key is to chose a posture
        early about the winning chances and threat level of the other decks — and keep to it — in order to
        try to tip the balance a little bit into one's favour.
    </p>
    <h2>Table strategies</h2>
    <p>
        Not everything around the table is about talking. Having a good sense of the table balance is essential to
        build an efficient table strategy as well. First, one should always <strong>lay low</strong> and avoid to focus
        the table attention to oneself. To this effect, table talk should be kept short, effective and pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most obvious fact about table strategy is the two players « cross table » are
        <strong>natural allies</strong>. The grand-prey will be leaning to help against the prey,
        and the grand-predator against the predator. Cultivating good rapports with them is important in the beginning.
        As the game progress though, they can become threats themselves.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
        <h3 class="tip-title">Hopping</h3>
        <p>
            A strategy uniquely available to vote constructs, hopping is going against the grand-prey pool
            before ousting the prey first. It is a good idea when the grand-prey deck has good block capacity:
            they do not get the chance to block the undirected vote actions until they are either
            the prey or the predator.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Finally, one should of course focus on <strong>eliminating its prey</strong>. However,
        when the predator is too threatening, some builds have the ability to <strong>go reverse</strong>,
        taking aggressive actions against their predator to oust them before their prey.
        A full reverse, taking predators down one after another for a 2 VP game win at the end, is hard to achieve:
        each predator gets 6 more pool out of the oust. However, going at least partially reverse during a game,
        ousting one predator to diminish the pressure, is a real possibility for some decks.
