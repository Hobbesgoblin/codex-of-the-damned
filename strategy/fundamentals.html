    <h1>Fundamentals</h1>
    <h2 id="bleed">Bleed</h2>
    <p>
        The root of the game win is to destroy one’s prey’s pool and the obvious way to do it is to bleed.
        Numerous cards in the game can enhance bleed.
        <i>d</i> and <i>r</i> give very strong bleed decks, but a swarm of minions also get the job done pretty fast.
        ¾ of edible decks will kill their prey by bleeding it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bleed modifiers like <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('conditioning')">Conditioning</span>
        should be played <strong>after the prey has declined to block</strong>.
        This way, they are more likely to get through.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
        <h3 class="tip-title">Limited and unlimited modifiers</h3>
        <p>
            Bleed modifiers are almost all <em>"limited"</em>, meaning one can play only one modifier increasing
            the bleed amount during a bleed action. However, a few cards provided non-limited bleed increase:
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('leverage')">Leverage</span>,
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('command-of-the-beast')">Command of the Beast</span> and
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('quicksilver-contemplation')">Quicksilver Contemplation</span>
            are played, more expensive ones are not.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        On the defence side, <strong>bounces</strong> like
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('deflection')">Deflection</span> or
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('telepathic-misdirection')">Telepathic Misdirection</span>
        should be played only <strong>after the bleed amount has been confirmed</strong>
        by the predator, after block has been declined.
        This way the modifier, if any, is likely to be redirected too.
        This is because once the predator confirms the bleed amount, he actually passes on his opportunity
        to play a modifier and do not get another opportunity if the prey does not play a modifier themselves.
        Note only <i>d</i> and <i>A</i> can provide bounce capability, and very few cards can directly counter them:
        only <i>e</i> with <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('touch-of-clarity')">Touch of Clarity</span>
        can cancel <i>d</i> bounces, but <i>A</i> bounces can be cancelled by
        <i>O</i> <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('hide-the-mind')">Hide the Mind</span>,
        <i>oy</i> <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('i-am-legion')">I am Legion</span> and
        <i>k</i> <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('false-resonance')">False Resonance</span>.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
        <h3 class="tip-title">Archon limit</h3>
        <p>
            A bleed for more than 3 exposes the minion to the possibility of
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('archon-investigation')">Archon Investigation</span>.
            Because of this card, 3 has become the <strong>archon limit</strong>:
            some decks will make sure to stay under it to avoid risking their minions,
            others will consider their minions expendable and get happily over it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="votes">Votes</h2>
    <p>
    The other option to deplete one’s prey’s pool is to use votes like
    <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('kine-resources-contested')">Kine Resources Contested</span>.
    The advantage of this strategy is the +1 stealth on the action. The disadvantage is that it is not directed:
    not only the prey but the predator can block, and the whole table can vote.
    </p>
    <p>
    The terms or the referendum are only announced <strong>once the action resolves</strong>.
    This means one can negotiate the vote as the action is announced, but only after blocks are declined
    and the action succeeds does one choose the official terms of the vote —
    and eventually betray everyone. The terms must be stated clearly once the action resolves,
    if just to confirm the Methusalah holds true to its word.
    </p>
    <p>
    In order to pass their votes, Methusalah will try to achieve a <strong>vote lock</strong>,
    meaning they have more votes of the table than the sum of all other players votes.
    Multiple techniques can be used to this effect:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Simply using <i>r</i>, as it offers a lot of modifiers to get more votes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('legacy-of-pander')">Legacy of Pander</span> with
            a lot of low cap Pander vampires.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('praxis-seizure-atlanta')">Praxis Seizure</span>,
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('crusade-atlanta')">Crusade</span> or
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('fee-stake-boston')">Fee Stake</span> cards.
        </li>
        <li>
            Getting multiple big capacity vampires with a lot of votes out, like Inner Circles and Justicars.
            This is usually achieved using
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('zillahs-valley')">Zillah's Valley</span> and
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('information-highway')">Information Highway</span>, together with
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('villein')">Villein</span> or
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('minion-tap')">Minion Tap</span>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 id="delay-and-diversity">Delay and diversity</h3>
    <p>
    Aggressive vote decks will pass multiple votes in a single turn, but this has led to the use of
    <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('delaying-tactics')">Delaying Tactics</span> as a defence.
    This means diversity in votes is needed to avoid loosing a whole turn of actions just because
    <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('kine-resources-contested')">Kine Resources Contested</span>
    has been delayed.
    <div class="tip">
        <h3 class="tip-title">Damage dealing votes</h3>
        <p>
            Only a few votes deal substantive pool damage, and they often have restrictions.
            Some votes dealing less damage are not listed here.
        </p>

    </div>
    </p>
    <h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
    <h3 id="ABC">ABC</h3>
    <p>
    One can either choose to buff up attack or to keep minions and cards to defend oneself:
    the stronger the defence, the weaker the attack, so it’s a question of balance in every deck.
    Whatever the balance though, a deck power is fundamentally about « ABC »,
    the <strong>A</strong>ctions & <strong>B</strong>locks <strong>C</strong>ount in a single turn.
    In any case, the ABC must be as high as possible for the deck to be effective.
    </p>
    <p>
    The most obvious way to increase ABC is to use a <strong>weenie</strong> crypt:
    many small vampires for more actions and blocks.
    Their lower capacity mean they are less powerful individually, but the higher ABC is worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
    Another option is to get more minions into play by recruiting Allies or using cards like
    <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('the-embrace')">The Embrace</span> to <strong>breed</strong>
    (<em>ie.</em> create new vampires).
    </p>
    <p>
    Yet another way to increase ABC is to use modifiers to engage in multiple actions with a single minion.
    This strategy is called <strong>drive</strong> in honour of
    <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('freak-drive')">Freak Drive</span>,
    one of the most played card to achieve this.
    Because the <strong>NRA</strong> (<strong>N</strong>on <strong>R</strong>epeatable <strong>A</strong>ction) rule
    states that no action can be engaged twice in the same turn by the same minion,
    this strategy has to be combined with a matching diversity in actions.
    </p>
    <p>
    Finally, the use of <strong>wake</strong> reactions like
    <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('wake-with-evenings-freshness')">Wake with Evening’s Freshness</span>
    also increases the ABC on the defence side.
    The card has been played so much its name has now become
    <a href=http://www.vekn.net/rulebook/11-special-terms>an official term</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="action-sequence">Action sequence</h3>
    <p>
    The choice and order of minion actions is important.
    A common strategy is to <strong>bait</strong>, beginning with the most mundane actions, up to the strongest ones.
    This forces the opponent to ponder what to block: too early and a devastating action could get through unopposed,
    too late and one could stay sitting for a big action than never comes.
    </p>
    <p>
    The other side of the medal is the <strong>gambit</strong> strategy: engaging in the heaviest action first
    in order to entice the opponent to keep a wake or an unlocked minion for an even uglier action that will,
    in fact, never come.
    </p>
    <p>
    The key to victory is to get a hand fit to oust one’s prey in the turn. Building this hand,
    then assessing the right moment to play it and <strong>lunge</strong> for the Victory Point is key.
    If the prey survives, they can rebuild their pool. Moreover, the rest of the table
    will tend to gang up against the predator. As a prey, one should take care to conceal its defensive capabilities —
    or lack of. As a predator, one should try to asses the number of wakes, bounces, delays, etc.
    available on the prey side.
    </p>
    <h3 id="stealth-and-intercept">Stealth and Intercept</h3>
    <p>
    The key between offence and defence is the management of stealth and intercept.
    Many disciplines give access to stealth and intercept.
    </p>
    <p>
    One level of intercept is enough to block hunts, votes, equipments and recruitments.
    Therefore, some decks include a limited capacity of <strong>permanent intercept</strong> like
    <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('wmrh-talk-radio')">WMRH Talk Radio</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('carlton-van-wyk')">Carlton Van Wyk</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('ponticulus')">Ponticulus</span> (Tremere) and
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('harzomatuili')">Harzomatuili</span> (Cardinal or Regent)
        deserve a special mention: they provide permanent intercept only to themeselves but their combat abilities
        is great and allow them to hinder the opponents all by themselves.

    <div class="tip">

    On the other hand, whatever level of intercept one manages to achieve, stealth specialised decks
    often include some <strong>block denial</strong> modifiers atop normal stealth.

    are the only full-purpose block denials of the game. However, <i>D</i> gives access to
    <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('seduction')">Seduction</span> which is still a strong denial,
    even if it is less efficient against wakes. Finally, many disciplines give access to lesser block denials
    that only work against allies and younger vampires, but they are less used as many walls use big capacity vampires.
