    <h2 id="bleed">Bleed</h2>
    <p>
        Bleed decks are focused on prey aggression and use bleed actions to inflict heavy pool damages.
        <i>d</i> is without question the most damage-heavy bleed discipline, plus it does come with bounce cards.
        <i>r</i> and <i>e</i> are good second choices.
        This is the archetype with the most wins, scoring 2:1 over other archetypes in major tournaments.
    </p>
    <h3>Stealth & Bleed and Powerbleed</h3>
    <p>
        There are two ways to get the bleed through: using <strong>stealth</strong> is the most obvious one.
        <i>o</i> is the obvious stealth discipline, but it does not often come along with <i>d</i>.
        <i>$</i> and <i>j</i> come second.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other way to get the bleed through is to make sure the prey has no minion available to block the action.
        Along its strong bleed capabilities, <i>d</i> offers the excellent
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('seduction')">Seduction</span>.
        <i>O</i> <span class="card" onclick="dC('elder-impersonation')">Elder Impersonation</span>,
        <i>N</i> <span class="card" onclick="dC('call-of-the-hungry-dead')">Call of the Hungry Dead</span>,
        <i>f</i> <span class="card" onclick="dC('daring-the-dawn')">Daring the Dawn</span> and
        <i>r</i> <span class="card" onclick="dC('mind-numb')">Mind Numb</span> are also effective tools.
        Combining these options with the few Master cards that can prevent block or lock minions —
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('pentex-tm-subversion')">Pentex™ Subversion</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('misdirection')">Misdirection</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('anarch-troublemaker')">Anarch Troublemaker</span> —
        stealth is not an issue anymore.

        the <a href="../archetypes/weenie-dem.html">Weenie DEM</a> archetype.
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
    <li>

        <a href="../archetypes/jost-powerbleed.html">Jost Powerbleed</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        Inner Circles also deliver a very strong bleed as they have a +2 bleed ability.
        The <a href="../archetypes/mistress.html">Mistress</a> archetype is a good example.
        They are often combined with
        <strong>M</strong>ulti <strong>M</strong>aster <strong>P</strong>hase <strong>A</strong>ctions (MMPA),
        like in the
        <a href="../archetypes/girls-will-find-inner-circle.html">Girls Will Find Inner Circle</a> or
        <a href="../archetypes/council-of-doom.html">Council of Doom</a> archetypes.

    <li>
        Using <i>J</i> to bleed multiple times during the opponents turns with
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('homunculus')">Homunculus</span> is also powerful:

        <a href="../archetypes/rachel-madness.html">Rachel Madness</a> are built around this idea.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <p>
        Bleed decks have the <strong>highest prey damage</strong>. They tend to oust their first prey quite often,
        but it also attracts the table attention on them and one oust is not enough for a game win.
        They are are usually <strong>weak in combat</strong>. They tend to rely on « combat ends » effects,
        but some flavours can have aggravated damage or torpor strikes as a threat.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
        <h3>Stealth rotation</h3>
        <p>
            Stealth & Bleed archetypes have a strong stealth module, but it can jam the hand.
            If the prey assumes she will not have the means to block, she should decide not to attempt to block at all,
            and <strong>try to jam her predator hand on the stealth module.</strong>
            Well constructed Stealth & Bleed decks include some rotation tools to help with that.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        As they are focused on their prey, bleed decks have a weak defence against their predator.
        They usually use <i>d</i> or <i>A</i> for bounces, but their bloat options are often mediocre.
    </p>
    <h2 id="vote">Vote</h2>
    <p>
        Vote decks usually have a strong pool damage module to deliver to their prey.
        The difficulty to gather enough votes to get the referendums through is balanced
        by the constant +1 stealth bonus of vote actions. There are basically two ways of building a vote deck:
        either breed and find a way to give votes to all your vampires, or use older vampires with titles themselves.
    </p>
    <h3>Flavours</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Inner Circle can be used in strong vote decks, as in

            <a href="../archetypes/lutz-politics.html">Lutz Politics</a>

        </li>
        <li>

            and Daughters of Cacophony, with

        </li>
        <li>
            Assamite also have good options, like in the

            <a href="../archetypes/death-star.html">Death Star</a> archetypes.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Ravnos have a unique breed archetype:
            the <a href="../archetypes/ravnos-clown-car.html">Ravnos Clown Car</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <p>
        Votes decks deliver <strong>very high damage</strong> once they get the vote lock.
        They also have a <strong>good bloat</strong>, using
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('consanguineous-boon')">Consanguineous Boon</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('parity-shift')">Parity Shift</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('ancient-influence')">Ancient Inluence</span> or
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('political-stranglehold')">Political Stranglehold</span>
        depending on the build.
        Depending on the exact build, <strong>stealth vary</strong>, but they are not easily blocked.
        Builds that do not have high stealth levels rely on a swarm of minions that make it hard to block them all.
        Finally, vote decks have a <strong>very weak combat module</strong> and — especially the swarm builds —
        a <strong>weak bleed defence</strong>, relying exclusively on bounces, if at all.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
        <h3>Table Talk</h3>
        <p>
            Votes can go either ways and can be targeted effortlessly across the table.
            This gives unique negotiation options to vote decks, that can be used to keep a low profile
            and a lot of friends throughout the game. Table talk is alwys important in the game,
            but even more so for vote archetypes.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="wall">Wall</h2>
    <p>
        Wall decks maximise their defence, trying to block their prey and predator actions alike while slowly
        building up bloat and pool damages. The ability to intercept and wake are tantamount in these decks,
        so <i>a</i> and <i>i</i> are the most common options here. <i>a</i> gives more options and a higher intercept
        all in all, with the excellent
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('eyes-of-argus')">Eyes of Argus</span> atop.
        It’s also the only discipline apart <i>d</i> that provides bleed bounce reaction cards.
        <i>i</i> also has good intercept cards though, and better combat options than <i>a</i>:
        it can be used with no additional equipment or discipline.
        Sabbat, Camarilla and Laibon titled vampires each have access to excellent intercept cards:
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('eternal-vigilance')">Eternal Vigilance</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('under-siege')">Under Siege</span>,

        <span class="card" onclick="dC('no-secrets-from-the-magaji')">No Secrets From the Magaji</span>.
    </p>
    <h3>Flavours</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <i>A</i> is the best intercept discipline, and the
            <a href="../archetypes/weenie-aus.html">Weenie AUS</a> wall is an obvious idea.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <a href="../archetypes/tzimisce-wall.html">Tzimisce Wall</a> is also a very classic archetype,
            as the combination of <i>a & i</i> offers even better intercept capabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tremere in general,
            but <span class="card" onclick="dC('goratrix')">Goratrix</span> in particular
            offer excellent wall capabilities in the
            <a href="../archetypes/goratrix-high-tower.html">Goratrix High Tower</a> archetype.
        </li>
        <li>

            disciplines combination.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally,
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('saulot-the-wanderer')">Saulot</span> &
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('the-capuchin')">The Capuchin</span>
            provide a nice discipline combination, as they both have <i>ATF</i> and +1 bleed.
            The <a href="../archetypes/saulot-and-friends.html">Saulot & Friends</a> archetype is built around them.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <p>
        Wall decks obviously have a <strong>strong defence</strong> and they're not easily taken down by their predator.
        Moreover, having high block capabilities let them play fragile master cards that need protection to be
        efficient like
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('smiling-jack-the-anarch')">Smiling Jack, the Anarch</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('the-rack')">The Rack</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('powerbase-montreal')">Powerbase: Montreal</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('powerbase-barranquilla')">Powerbase: Barranquilla</span> (Sabbat) and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('anarch-revolt')">Anarch Revolt</span> (Anarchs),
        helping both with bloat and offence.
        Still, wall decks tend to have a <strong>weak offence</strong>, dealing only a moderate
        amount of damage to their prey. They're very good at exhausting other decks around the table though, and will
        get their prey eventually if they manage to survive their predator.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
        <h3>Cross block</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('eagles-sight')">Eagle's Sight</span> and
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('falcons-eye')">Falcon's Eye</span> are the only two cards in
            the game that let a vampire block <strong>any</strong> action, even if it is directed upon another
            Methusalah or undertaken cross table.
        </p>
        <p>
            This ability to cross block is an excellent asset in wall decks with <i>A</i> or <i>Z</i>
            as it enhances table control and allows for example to intercept and dangerous vote from the grand-predator
            or a bleed from the prey that could be lethal to the grand-prey.
            Wall decks that do not use these will often include some rush capabilities instead.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="toolbox">Toolbox</h2>
    <p>
    Toolbox decks balance their offence and defence capabilities. They have a wall tendency,
    a decent combat module and real pool damage options to use on their prey,
    sometimes even some votes they can try to pass or tactical stealth options.
    The key to this archetype is to use cards offering multiple play options.
    </p>
    <h2>Flavours</h2>

        </li>
        <li>
            A lot of archetypes using allies also fall into this category, like

            <a href="../archetypes/emerald-legion.html">Emerald Legion</a> and

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            The Tremere too have a good disciplines combination for a toolbox, as proves the
            <a href="../archetypes/war-chantry.html">War Chantry</a> archetype.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Versatility</strong> is obviously the best asset of a toolbox deck.
        It can handle and exploit any table configuration. To make the most out of toolbox decks,
        one has to display excellent table awareness and negotiation abilities.
        For the toolbox to have a proper effect around the table and display all its efficiency,
        one needs to <strong>play their hand</strong>, whatever is in it.
        The deck chooses the strategy as much as the Methusalah.
        The player still chooses on which target to use its cards,
        but the cards in hand demand to be played for the deck to shine.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
            <h3>The Heart of Cheating</h3>
            <p>
                The <span class="card" onclick="dC('heart-of-nizchetus')">Heart of Nizchetus</span>
                is often included in toolbox builds,
                as it gives more control to the Methusalah over what his play can be.
                Its effect is makes such a difference in efficiency in such builds, it has been nicknamed
                <em>The Heart of Cheating</em>.
            </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Finally, toolbox decks have <strong>strong defence</strong>, although not as strong as wall decks.
        They tend to have good intercept options and/or rush capabilities to handle their predator.
        Having much less offensive options than a vote or S&B deck, they cannot rely on pure speed to best their predator:
        they have to deter its actions actively using blocks, bounces or combats depending on the build.
    </p>
    <h2 id="rush">Rush</h2>
    <p>
    Rush decks use combat as their main weapon. Many disciplines have good combat options.
    They are also good combat cards with no discipline. This is the archetype with the least wins in major tournaments,
    scoring 1:2 against other archetypes, 1:4 against bleed decks.
    Getting vampires down around the table is fun, but does not help so much to get the prey's pool down.
    To this effect, a handful of cards can help, namely
    <span class="card" onclick="dC('fame')">Fame</span>,
    <span class="card" onclick="dC('dragonbound')">Dragonbound</span> and

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <p>
        The ability to rush any minion provide these decks with a <strong>strong defence</strong>
        against their predator. Depending on the predator archetype, going against its minions first
        is a common strategy for a rush deck: it may take some combats to get them down,
        but they can disable their predator very fast. On the other hand, rush decks have
        a <strong>weak offence</strong> and have trouble finding a way to deliver pool damage to their prey.
        This is the core issue of the archetype and explains its low-grade results in tournaments.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
        <h3>Finnish Politics</h3>
        <p>
            If they do not take down their prey very fast, rush decks have a unique control over the table balance
            as they can enter combat with the minions of any Methusalah — and take them down. Proper table control is
            essential to the succes of such builds, but it also opens a unique strategy for negociation:
            using the threat of rush combat to get things out of your neighbours.
        </p>
        <p>
            The finnish players have perfect this negociation strategy to such an extent, it is now known as
            <em>"Finnish Politics"</em> among the seasoned players.

            The <a href="../archetypes/cybelotron.html">Cybelotron</a>
            is a build created by <em>Erik Torstensson</em> in 2007 and refined by <em>Ben Peal</em> in 2007.
            It uses a complicated combination to use
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('call-the-great-beast')">Call the Great Beast</span> efficiently.

        <li>
            The <a href="../archetypes/madness-reversal.html">Madness Reversal</a>
            is a build created by <em>Orian Gissler</em> in 2009 and refined
            by <em>Danilo Torrisi</em> in 2017. It uses
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('reversal-of-fortunes')">Reversal of Fortunes</span> to play twice or thrice
            as more as its opponents.

    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <p>
        Special decks tend to uge complicated card combinations to a devastative effect. Their strenght is in
        the <strong>absolute advantage</strong> their combination provide if all gets well. Their weakness
        is the frailty of such a combination. Blocking the right action or countering the right Master can often
        stop them dead in their tracks. Moreover, known combinations tend to attract the attention of all players,
        often leading the Player to lose all its ally very early in the game.
