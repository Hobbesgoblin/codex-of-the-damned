    <h2 id="bleed">Bleed</h2>
    <p>
        Bleed decks are focused on prey aggression and use bleed actions to inflict heavy pool damages.
        <i>d</i> is without question the most damage-heavy bleed discipline, plus it does come with bounce cards.
        <i>r</i> and <i>e</i> are good second choices.
        This is the archetype with the most wins, scoring 2:1 over other archetypes in major tournaments.
    </p>
    <h3>Stealth & Bleed and Powerbleed</h3>
    <p>
        There are two ways to get the bleed through: using <strong>stealth</strong> is the most obvious one.
        <i>o</i> is the obvious stealth discipline, but it does not often come along with <i>d</i>.
        <i>$</i> and <i>j</i> come second.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other way to get the bleed through is to make sure the prey has no minion available to block the action.
        Along its strong bleed capabilities, <i>d</i> offers the excellent
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('seduction')">Seduction</span>.
        <i>O</i> <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('elder-impersonation')">Elder Impersonation</span>,
        <i>N</i> <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('call-of-the-hungry-dead')">Call of the Hungry Dead</span>,
        <i>f</i> <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('daring-the-dawn')">Daring the Dawn</span> and
        <i>r</i> <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('mind-numb')">Mind Numb</span> are also effective tools.
        Combining these options with the few Master cards that can prevent block or lock minions —

        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('misdirection')">Misdirection</span> and

    <ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Lasombra and Kiasyd</strong> have a strong combination with <i>d</i> for bleed and <i>$</i> for stealth.
        Moreover, they can use some <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('nocturn')">Nocturn</span> for defence or

        But the malkavian clan also gave birth to the <strong>Weenie DEM</strong> archetype, using low capacity vampires

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Inner Circles</strong> also deliver a very strong bleed as they have a +2 bleed ability,
        and often access to the <i>D</i> and <i>O</i> combination.

    </li>
    <li>
        <strong><span class="card" onclick="displayCard('the-unnamed')">The unnamed</span></strong> ability has been
        enough to give birth to an archetype by itself. Though he lacks <i>d</i> or <i>A</i> for bounces, he can
        produce a nice bloat by himself, more so once he gets the
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('enkil-cog')">Enkil Cog</span> +
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('homunculus')">Homunculus</span>
        combination out and begins to bleed twice per turn.
        With <i>O</i> and <i>J</i>, his stealth can be almost impossible to match, and he has access to
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('instantaneous-transformation')">Instantaneous Transformation</span>
        for more actions, as well as
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('unleash-hells-fury')">Unleash Hell's Fury</span> for defence.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <p>
        Bleed decks have the <strong>highest prey damage</strong>. They tend to oust their first prey quite often,
        but it also attracts the table attention on them and one oust is not enough for a game win.
        They are are usually <strong>weak in combat</strong>. They tend to rely on « combat ends » effects,
        but some flavours can have aggravated damage or torpor strikes as a threat.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
        <h3 class="tip-title">Stealth rotation</h3>
        <p>
            Stealth & Bleed archetypes have a strong stealth module, but it can jam the hand.
            If the prey assumes she will not have the means to block, she should decide not to attempt to block at all,
            and <strong>try to jam her predator hand on the stealth module.</strong>
            Well constructed Stealth & Bleed decks include some rotation tools to help with that.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        As they are focused on their prey, bleed decks have a weak defence against their predator.
        They usually use <i>d</i> or <i>A</i> for bounces, but their bloat options are often mediocre.
    </p>
    <h2 id="vote">Vote</h2>
    <p>
        Vote decks usually have a strong pool damage module to deliver to their prey.
        The difficulty to gather enough votes to get the referendums through is balanced
        by the constant +1 stealth bonus of vote actions. There are basically two ways of building a vote deck:
        either breed and find a way to give votes to all your vampires, or use older vampires with titles themselves.
    </p>
    <h3>Flavours</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Inner Circle</strong> can be used in strong vote decks. As in the build variant,
            getting the out is often done using
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('zillahs-valley')">Zillah's Valley</span> and
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('information-highway')">Information Highway</span>, together with
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('villein')">Villein</span> or
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('minion-tap')">Minion Tap</span>.
            On the vote topic,
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('lutz-von-hohenzollern')">Lutz Von Hohenzollern</span> deserves
            a special mention, as his ability and disciplines makes him perfect for the job. Many different decks have
            been built around him.
            An interesting variant, <strong>Summon the Elder</strong>, uses
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('al-muntathir-gods-witness')">Al-Muntathir, God's Witness</span>
            and its unique <i>!</i> discipline to play
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('summon-history')">Summon History</span> then
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('the-ankara-citadel-turkey')">The Ankara Citadel, Turkey</span>
            to get more IC into play faster, at half the price.
            the excellent <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('voter-captivation')">Voter Captivation</span>
            is then used to resplenish the vampires blood before going at it again, or using a
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('villein')">Villein</span> to bloat.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Brujah Princes</strong> also offer an excellent crypt for votes, especially with
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('dmitra-ilyanova')">Dmitra Ilyanova</span>.
            As for all Camarilla builds, their access to
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('parity-shift')">Parity Shift</span> is a great asset,
            plus <i>r</i> action modifiers let them make sure the votes get through and provide the excellent
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('voter-captivation')">Voter Captivation</span> for bloating.
        </li>
        <li>
            Balli offer a nice political angle: the <strong>Dark side of Politics</strong> archetype
            makes use of <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('kaymakli-fragment')">Kaymakli Fragment</span>
            to get multiple Inner Circle or Justicars in play.
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('giotto-verducci')">Giotto Verducci</span> is used to this effect,
            as his ability let him get the equipment easily.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <strong><span class="card" onclick="displayCard('legacy-of-pander')">Legacy of Pander</span></strong>
            card made for an archetype by itself: playing it with low capacity Pander vampires that breed using
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('the-embrace')">The Embrace</span> can get the vote lock
            soon and deliver a high amount of pool damage very fast. Moreover, having a swarm of vampires ensures
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('consanguineous-boon')">Consanguineous Boon</span> can be used
            for bloating very strong.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <strong>Ravnos Clown Car</strong> is another interesting breed build. Getting low capacity Ravnos out,
            then having them use
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('mozambique-allure')">Mozambique Allure</span> to become Laibon,
            then <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('the-embrace')">The Embrace</span> to get more Ravnos out,
            makes for an incredible voteing power using
            then <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('the-eldest-are-kholo')">The Eldest are Kholo</span>.
            Moreover, the Ravnos clan also has access to the

        </li>
        <li>
            Toreador antitribu also have a powerful political breed using
            <strong><span class="card" onclick="displayCard('foundation-exhibit')">Foundation Exhibit</span></strong>.
            Moreover, they also have access to the deadly
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('palla-grande')">Palla Grande</span> and can combine the two
            masters to deadly effect.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <p>
        Votes decks deliver <strong>very high damage</strong> once they get the vote lock.
        They also have a <strong>good bloat</strong>, using
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('consanguineous-boon')">Consanguineous Boon</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('parity-shift')">Parity Shift</span>,

        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('political-stranglehold')">Political Stranglehold</span>
        depending on the build.
        Depending on the exact build, <strong>stealth vary</strong>, but they are not easily blocked.
        Builds that do not have high stealth levels rely on a swarm of minions that make it hard to block them all.
        Finally, vote decks have a <strong>very weak combat module</strong> and — especially the swarm builds —
        a <strong>weak bleed defence</strong>, relying exclusively on bounces, if at all.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
        <h3 class="tip-title">Table Talk</h3>
        <p>
            Votes can go either ways and can be targeted effortlessly across the table.
            This gives unique negotiation options to vote decks, that can be used to keep a low profile
            and a lot of friends throughout the game. Table talk is alwys important in the game,
            but even more so for vote archetypes.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="wall">Wall</h2>
    <p>
        Wall decks maximise their defence, trying to block their prey and predator actions alike while slowly
        building up bloat and pool damages. The ability to intercept and wake are tantamount in these decks,
        so <i>a</i> and <i>i</i> are the most common options here. <i>a</i> gives more options and a higher intercept
        all in all, with the excellent
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('eyes-of-argus')">Eyes of Argus</span> atop.
        It’s also the only discipline apart <i>d</i> that provides bleed bounce reaction cards.
        <i>i</i> also has good intercept cards though, and better combat options than <i>a</i>:
        it can be used with no additional equipment or discipline.
        Sabbat, Camarilla and Laibon titled vampires each have access to excellent intercept cards:
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('eternal-vigilance')">Eternal Vigilance</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('under-siege')">Under Siege</span>,

    </p>
    <h3>Flavours</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Weenie</strong> walls are a standard build, playing low capacity vampires either with <i>a</i>
            and guns like <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('under-siege')">Sniper Rifle</span> and
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('44-magnum')">.44 Magnum</span>, or with <i>i</i> and
            the versatile <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('deep-song')">Deep Song</span>.
            The number of vampires compensate their frailty — the deck may struggle against high levels of stealth,
            but can handle powerbleed or other weenie decks more easily.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <strong>Tzimisce</strong> wall is a very classic build. The combination of both <i>a & i</i> allows
            for the use of <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('read-the-winds')">Read the Winds</span>, and
            high cap vampires can even use
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('sense-the-savage-way')">Sense the Savage Way</span>.
            On top of <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('eyes-of-argus')">Eyes of Argus</span>
            this allows a build with a lot more wakes. Tzimisce can also use <i>v</i> for an aggravated damage
            combat module using
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('breath-of-the-dragon')">Breath of the Dragon</span> and
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('chiropteran-marauder')">Chiropteran Marauder</span>, threatening
            to use <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('rotschreck')">Rötschreck</span> if needed,
            as they usually enter combat as blockers and can therefore play an Out-of-Turn.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tremere in general,
            but <strong><span class="card" onclick="displayCard('goratrix')">Goratrix</span></strong> in particular
            offer excellent wall capabilities. He has the same <i>A & I</i> disciplines as strong Tzimisce,

        Wall decks obviously have a <strong>strong defence</strong> and they're not easily taken down by their predator.
        Moreover, having high block capabilities let them play fragile master cards that need protection to be
        efficient like
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('smiling-jack-the-anarch')">Smiling Jack, the Anarch</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('the-rack')">The Rack</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('powerbase-montreal')">Powerbase: Montreal</span>,
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('powerbase-barranquilla')">Powerbase: Barranquilla</span> (Sabbat) and
        <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('anarch-revolt')">Anarch Revolt</span> (Anarchs),
        helping both with bloat and offence.
        Still, wall decks tend to have a <strong>weak offence</strong>, dealing only a moderate
        amount of damage to their prey. They're very good at exhausting other decks around the table though, and will
        get their prey eventually if they manage to survive their predator.

        <h3 class="tip-title">Cross block</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('eagles-sight')">Eagle's Sight</span> and
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('falcons-eye')">Falcon's Eye</span> are the only two cards in
            the game that let a vampire block <strong>any</strong> action, even if it is directed upon another
            Methusalah or undertaken cross table.
        </p>
        <p>
            This ability to cross block is an excellent asset in wall decks with <i>A</i> or <i>Z</i>
            as it enhances table control and allows for example to intercept and dangerous vote from the grand-predator
            or a bleed from the prey that could be lethal to the grand-prey.
            Wall decks that do not use these will often include some rush capabilities instead.

    <h2 id="toolbox">Toolbox</h2>
    <p>
    Toolbox decks balance their offence and defence capabilities. They have a wall tendency,
    a decent combat module and real pool damage options to use on their prey,
    sometimes even some votes they can try to pass or tactical stealth options.
    The key to this archetype is to use cards offering multiple play options.

            Using Toreador Princes and Justicar led to the <strong>AAA</strong> archetype and its family.
            The name come from the vampires used in the crypt:
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('Anson')">Anson</span>,

            A variant uses only

            the <strong>Anson guns</strong> archetype.
            Using a Prince and Justicar allows to play

            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('parity-shift')">Parity Shift</span>.
            The combat module can use either <i>r</i> combat ends or <i>c</i> with guns.
            <i>r</i> delivers good bleed damage, espacially since
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('aire-of-elation')">Aire of Elation</span> is stronger on a

            In this case, <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('the-parthenon')">The Parthenon</span> and a dozen
            of <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('ashur-tablets')">Ashur Tablets</span> are included.
            On the other hand, having the Justicar and the Inner Circle in the crypt allows the play of

            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('assault-rifle')">Assault Rifle</span> to strengthen the

        <li>
            A few group 2 Brujah have the <i>d</i> discipline, and this led to the <strong>Euro Brujah</strong>

            The MMPA side of things allows to play a dozen

        <li>
            The <strong><span class="card" onclick="displayCard('nephandus')">Nephandus</span></strong> led to a build
            of his own, along <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('antonio-derlette')">Antonio d'Erlette</span>.
            The idea is to use this powerful ally in swarm, playing no-discipline combat cards like

            The <strong>Emerald Legion</strong> archetype uses the

            of the deck, along some
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('liquidation')">Liquidation</span> to make the most of its ability.
            Using Harbinger of Skulls vampires led to solid defensive toolbox decks, with <i>A</i> for block

        <li>
            The <strong>Ventrue Antitribu Grinder</strong> build is a classic toolbox archetype.

            The idea is to slowly <em>grind</em> the blood and pool around the table to get to victory.
        </li>
        <li>
            The True Brujah and their unique <i>?</i> discipline brought an interesting toolbox build using
            <strong><span class="card" onclick="displayCard('summon-history')">Summon History</span></strong>.
            Two versions exist, one using
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('shalmath')">Shalmath</span> to act twice per turn, another using

            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('summon-history')">Summon History</span> ignores requirements and
            allows to fetch clan-specific cards:
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('the-ankara-citadel-turkey')">The Ankara Citadel, Turkey</span>
            first to get the following ones cheap, then
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('harzomatuili')">Harzomatuili</span> and
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('ponticulus')">Ponticulus</span> for defence, sometimes
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('remnant-of-the-endless-storm')">Remnant of the Endless Storm</span>
            for offence.
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('malajit-chandramouli')">Malajit Chandramouli</span> is also
            included for more stealth.

            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('domain-of-evernight')">Domain of Evernight</span> +
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('outside-the-hourglass')">Outside the Hourglass</span> combination,
            inflicting two aggravated damages before strikes. This gets around most damage prevention, combat ends
            and dodges. The Lydia-Munthatir crypt usually uses
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('vaticination')">Vaticination</span> and
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('quicksilver-contemplation')">Quicksilver Contemplation</span>
            to discard bounces in the prey hand before bleeding strongly.
        </li>

    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Versatility</strong> is obviously the best asset of a toolbox deck.
        It can handle and exploit any table configuration. To make the most out of toolbox decks,
        one has to display excellent table awareness and negotiation abilities.
        For the toolbox to have a proper effect around the table and display all its efficiency,
        one needs to <strong>play their hand</strong>, whatever is in it.
        The deck chooses the strategy as much as the Methusalah.
        The player still chooses on which target to use its cards,
        but the cards in hand demand to be played for the deck to shine.
    </p>
    <div class="tip">
            <h3 class="tip-title">The Heart of Cheating</h3>
            <p>
                The <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('heart-of-nizchetus')">Heart of Nizchetus</span>
                is often included in toolbox builds,
                as it gives more control to the Methusalah over what his play can be.
                Its effect is makes such a difference in efficiency in such builds, it has been nicknamed
                <em>The Heart of Cheating</em>.
            </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        Finally, toolbox decks have <strong>strong defence</strong>, although not as strong as wall decks.
        They tend to have good intercept options and/or rush capabilities to handle their predator.
        Having much less offensive options than a vote or S&B deck, they cannot rely on pure speed to best their predator:
        they have to deter its actions actively using blocks, bounces or combats depending on the build.
    </p>
    <h2 id="rush">Rush</h2>
    <p>
    Rush decks use combat as their main weapon. Many disciplines have good combat options.
    They are also good combat cards with no discipline. This is the archetype with the least wins in major tournaments,
    scoring 1:2 against other archetypes, 1:4 against bleed decks.
    Getting vampires down around the table is fun, but does not help so much to get the prey's pool down.
    To this effect, a handful of cards can help, namely
    <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('fame')">Fame</span>,
    <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('dragonbound')">Dragonbound</span> and

            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('sense-the-savage-way')">Sense the Savage Way</span> and

    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <p>
        The ability to rush any minion provide these decks with a <strong>strong defence</strong>
        against their predator. Depending on the predator archetype, going against its minions first
        is a common strategy for a rush deck: it may take some combats to get them down,
        but they can disable their predator very fast. On the other hand, rush decks have
        a <strong>weak offence</strong> and have trouble finding a way to deliver pool damage to their prey.
        This is the core issue of the archetype and explains its low-grade results in tournaments.

        <p>
            If they do not take down their prey very fast, rush decks have a unique control over the table balance
            as they can enter combat with the minions of any Methusalah — and take them down. Proper table control is
            essential to the succes of such builds, but it also opens a unique strategy for negociation:
            using the threat of rush combat to get things out of your neighbours.
        </p>
        <p>
            The finnish players have perfect this negociation strategy to such an extent, it is now known as
            <em>"Finnish Politics"</em> among the seasoned players.

        Some decks do not fit into any of the aforementioned archetypes.
        These rare constructs are unique combinations of library and crypt cards that proved unexpectedly efficient.
        The following examples are not exhaustive.

    <h3>Flavours</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The <strong>Cybelotron</strong> is a build created by <em>Erik Torstensson</em> in 2007
            and refined by <em>Ben Peal</em> in 2007.
            It has a crypt of 12 <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('cybele')">Cybele</span>, use
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('magic-of-the-smith')">Magic of the Smith</span> to get a
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('soul-gem-of-etrius')">Soul Gem of Etrius</span> out, add a
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('fortitude')">Master: Discipline</span> to get Cybele to
            11 capacity, in order to be able to play
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('call-the-great-beast')">Call the Great Beast</span>,
            spawning the Great Beast immediatly and getting a fresh new Cybele out of the crypt, thanks to the
            Soul Gem.
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('golconda-inner-peace')">Golconda: Inner Peace</span> and
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('redeem-the-lost-soul')">Redeem the Lost Soul</span> are used
            for heavy bloating.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <strong>Madness Reversal</strong> is a build created by <em>Orian Gissler</em> in 2009 and refined
            by <em>Danilo Torrisi</em> in 2015. It uses low capacity Malkavians along
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('madness-network')">Madness Network</span> to let them call the
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('reversal-of-fortunes')">Reversal of Fortunes</span> vote
            during other players turn to play twice or thrice as much as the rest of the table.
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('the-parthenon')">The Parthenon</span> and
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('brainwash')">Brainwash</span> are used to slow the neighbours
            game even more,
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('smiling-jack-the-anarch')">Smiling Jack, the Anarch</span>
            helps to kill the table faster.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <strong>Baltimore Purge</strong> is a classic build, made quite stronger with the edition of
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('montano')">Montano</span> in 2016.
            The idea is to have the elder Lasombra play
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('baltimore-purge')">Baltimore Purge</span>, then use
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('freak-drive')">Freak Drive</span> and
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('graverobbing')">Graverobbing</span> to <em>steal</em> its prey
            vampires.
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('mind-rape')">Mind Rape</span> is played alongside, and
            eventually
            <span class="card" onclick="displayCard('heidelberg-castle-germany')">Heidelberg Castle, Germany</span>
            helps make use of the blood on the stolen vampires.
            The rest of the deck is a standard and powerful Stealth & Bleed module fitting the Lasombra <i>D£</i>
            disciplines.

    </ul>
    <h3>Highlights</h3>
    <p>
        Special decks tend to uge complicated card combinations to a devastative effect. Their strenght is in
        the <strong>absolute advantage</strong> their combination provide if all gets well. Their weakness
        is the frailty of such a combination. Blocking the right action or countering the right Master can often
        stop them dead in their tracks. Moreover, known combinations tend to attract the attention of all players,
        often leading the Player to lose all its ally very early in the game.
