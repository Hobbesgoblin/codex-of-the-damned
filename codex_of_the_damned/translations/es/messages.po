"<h2>Highlights</h2> <p> This is an Akunanse <em>wall</em> deck, using "
"%(ABO)s%(ANI)s%(FOR)s. It leans on the <em>toolbox</em> side of things. "
"Depending on the build, it can be a pure wall or use <em>Magaji</em> and "
"include some political cards. The idea is to use the classical big "
"capacity %(ani)s Intercept combination (%(raven_spy)s, %(cats_guidance)s,"
" %(sense_the_savage_way)s) combined with the excellent %(abo)s "
"wake/intercept card: %(predators_communion)s. </p> <p> The combat module "
"is short-ranged, using %(invoking_the_beast)s in combination with "
"%(carrion_crows)s. %(for)s provides a welcome damage prevention for more "
"sturdiness. </p> <p> This is a slow play, slowing down the prey and "
"predator and bloating a bit with Master cards, all the while bleeding "
"when possible with %(deep_song)s and %(predators_mastery)s. </p> <h2>Tips"
" & Tricks</h2> <p> As Akunanse are Laibon, they have access to some niche"
" cards: %(powerbase_luanda)s is invaluable for increasing the rush power,"
" %(well_marked)s helps with damage mitigation and %(shaman)s is slightly "
"better than a %(raven_spy)s. </p> <p> %(for)s provides the excellent "
"%(freak_drive)s, improving %(a_b)s quite a bit. </p> <p> Combining the "
"big capacity vampires access to %(sense_the_savage_way)s with "
"%(predators_communion)s and %(cats_guidance)s means every reaction card "
"is a wake of some kind. This makes for a strong wall. </p> <p> Both "
"%(fakir_al_sidi)s and %(matata)s have a +1 strength bonus and a press, a "
"nice combination for the short-ranged combat module. </p> <h2>Creator "
"Insights</h2> <p> <em>Dávid Farkas</em> was kind enough to provide the "
"following insights: </p> <p> The biggest strenght of the deck are "
"<strong>permanency</strong> and <strong>versatility</strong>. </p> <p> By"
" <strong>permanency</strong>, I mean that even with 100%% hand jam, the "
"deck can function just fine. %(fakir_al_sidi)s and %(matata)s can both "
"fight a combat and deal a total of 4 damage without a single card. "
"Permanent intercept is also awesome. </p> <p> As for "
"<strong>versatility</strong>, every single intercept reaction is also a "
"form of wake. The fact that %(deep_song)s is both a rush and a bleed "
"means that the deck has an usual lunge potential, as he can bleed for 9 "
"with 3 minions. </p> <h2>Variants</h2> <p> Minor variations exist for the"
" combat module, as it can also contain %(devil_channel_back)s and/or "
"%(devil_channel_hands)s. </p> <p> An original module played by "
"%(michael_bartsch)s in 2015 uses %(pack_alpha)s alongside %(duma_rafiki)s"
" and %(elephant_guardian)s. </p> <p> Many versions of this deck also "
"include the %(abombwe)s discipline card: as it's a <em>Trifle</em>, hence"
" a cheap card to improve %(fakir_al_sidi)s or %(sanjo)s. </p> <p> The "
"<strong>Magaji</strong> variant disregards %(fakir_al_sidi)s and "
"%(matata)s to use the <em>Magaji</em> %(umdava)s and %(nkule_galadima)s "

"<h2>Highlights</h2> <p> This is an Ahrimanes wall deck using group 4 "
"Ahrimanes. Depending on the build, it can be a pure wall or more of a "
"toolbox. The core concept is to use the rather classical %(ani)s "
"Intercept/Combat combination — %(raven_spy)s, %(cats_guidance)s, "
"%(aid_from_bats)s and %(carrion_crows)s — combined with %(spi)s intercept"
" and combat enhancers: %(falcons_eye)s, %(speak_with_spirits)s, "
"%(ears_of_the_hare)s and %(swiftness_of_the_stag)s. </p> <p> This is a "
"slow play, slowing down the prey and predator and bloating a bit with "
"Master cards, all the while bleeding when possible with %(deep_song)s and"
" dealing additional pool damage with %(fame)s and %(dragonbound)s. </p> "
"<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2> <p> As Ahrimanes are Sabbat, they have access to "
"%(abbot)s, an excellent intercept enhancer. Having %(spi)s for intercept "
"allows to drop the classical %(raven_spy)s completely, although most "
"builds of this archetype still include it, sometimes along "
"%(muricias_call)s and some other animal retainers. </p> <p> %(spi)s also "
"provides %(engling_fury)s, an excellent blood regeneration tool which, "
"along %(taste_of_vitae)s, helps the Master %(leeching)s bloat module. "
"</p> <p> The %(ani)s combat module always includes some cards against "
"weapon modules to be able to handle some %(ivory_bow)s, %(magnum)s or "
"%(sniper_rifle)s on the opponent side. To this effect and depending on "
"the context, %(drawing_out_the_beast)s, %(canine_horde)s or "
"%(terror_frenzy)s can be used. </p> <p> If allies are expected, "
"%(vultures_buffet)s can be preferred to %(engling_fury)s and "
"%(entrancement)s can be added to the mix. </p> <h2>Creator Insights</h2> "
"<p> <em>Randal Rudstam</em> was kind enough to provide the following "
"insights: </p> <p> Getting into the three player endgame is more of a "
"priority than getting the first or second oust. </p> <p> A third way to "
"play them is to go Anarch, remove %(abbot)s for some %(anarch_revolt)s "
"and access to %(field_training)s. </p> <h2>Variants</h2> <p> The main "
"variant is a <em>wall</em> construct as given in example. Some may "
"include %(pre)s cards to help on the bleeding side, like "
"%(legal_manipulations)s and %(aire_of_elation)s. %(underbridge_stray)s is"
" also a common inclusion, as well as %(smiling_jack_the_anarch)s. "
"%(yoann_guyaders_deck)s from the 2013 French NC is a an exemple. </p> <p>"
" The <strong>Howler</strong> variant is less frequent, it is a group 2 "
"build using %(howler)s and %(the_siamese)s. Group 2 vampires are a bit "
"more expensive and do miss a bit of superior %(ANI)s, so it makes "
"including some %(animalism)s quite necessary. On the other hand, the "
"slightly bigger capacity allows for the use of %(sense_the_savage_way)s "
"to increase intercept capabilities, and %(PRE)s is more present and "
"allows for a more aggressive bleed module. %(stephen_sings_deck)s from "
"the 2011 Asian Continental Championship is an example of this approach. "

"<h2>Highlights</h2> <p> This is an <em>allies toolbox</em> deck using "
"multiple unique allies. The idea is to put %(khazar_s_diary)s into play, "
"breed a bit with %(the_embrace)s, defend by putting some allies into play"
" and wait until %(khazar_s_diary)s triggers. At this point, the dead "
"allies come back into play as wraith to stealth & bleed the successive "
"preys out of the game. </p> <p> The high recursion using "
"%(sudario_refraction)s is a strong point of the deck, allowing it to "
"adapt its defence to the table context. It is very passive in the game "
"beginning and uses %(deflection)s and %(delaying_tactics)s to defend a "
"much as possible. </p> <p> The deck is focused on bringing as many "
"minions into play as possible, and relies a lot on the allies and their "
"capacities. As such, it does have only limited combat, bleed or stealth "
"modules. However, it hopes to quickly bring into play good rush or "
"intercept allies like %(carlton_van_wyk)s, %(ossian)s and "
"%(shambling_hordes)s to improve its defence. </p> <p> "
"%(shambling_hordes)s is a particularily strong rush minion: it is not "
"<em>Unique</em> (and as such does not add a counter to %(khazar_s_diary)s"
" when it burns), but it is strong enough a defence to be included "
"nonetheless. And given the rest of the deck mechanics and the numerous "
"%(liquidation)s, it will easily find an ally in the ash heap. </p> <p> "
"%(the_unmasking)s and %(fbi_special_affairs_division)s help making all "
"these allies stronger defenders when they come into play. </p> <h2>Tips &"
" Tricks</h2> <p> %(jake_washington)s is an excellent device in this deck "
"as burning him in any way will add one counter on %(khazar_s_diary)s "
"easily. </p> <p> This variant uses %(the_parthenon)s to get to play more "
"masters and improve its bloat with %(liquidation)s and %(vessel)s. "
"Destroying some %(blood_doll)s using %(vessel)s has a bit of value in "
"this deck, as %(gregory_winter)s and %(young_bloods)s can stack over the "
"rush allies to bring a strong blood attrition to the table. </p> <p> "
"%(repo_man)s is a cheap unique ally, and, with his 1 life, dies pretty "
"quickly if he blocks. Which is the point when one uses "
"%(khazar_s_diary)s. </p> <h2>Variants</h2> <p> Minor variations exist, "
"for example %(inaki_puigdollers_s_deck)s from 2009 uses "
"%(change_of_target)s to help protect the minions — even the allies — from"
" unforseen blocks. He also included some %(tupdogs)s in the crypt: they "
"can not undertake directed actions but they avoid repeating minions in "
"the crypt, they can still block, recruit an ally like the %(repo_man)s, "
"and provide one more minion to bring back as a wraith once "
"%(khazar_s_diary)s kicks in. </p> <p> The <strong>Anarch</strong> "
"variant, as seen in %(roberto_venturi_s_deck)s from 2011, uses "
"%(anarch_convert)s for a better rotation and to make all these Giovanni "
"Anarch, so they can use %(cry_wolf)s, an exceptionnaly well suited ally "
"for the %(khazar_s_diary)s: it is unique and burns automatically. It "
"provides the same kind of rush defence %(ossian)s and "
"%(shambling_hordes)s do in the example deck. </p> <p> The "
"<strong>Faeries</strong> variant was played in "
"%(enrico_de_stefano_s_deck)s from 2018. It uses a dozen "
"%(draeven_softfoot)s and their burn option to quickly bring more allies "
"into the ash heap, making it easier to get %(shambling_hordes)s into "
"play. It also uses more copies of %(the_embrace)s and %(khazar_s_diary)s "
"as the idea is to trigger the Diary sooner, and bring all these "
"%(draeven_softfoot)s back as wraith with the new born vampires, for a "
"faster, more aggressive version of the archetype. </p>"

"one, <em>etc.</em>). If you're too agressive, your prey will only "
"influence one vampire, and you want the prey to play and do something to "
"the grandprey. It's not a problem if the prey gains 1PV. When you have 3 "
"or more Kiasyds and the prey has less than 15 pool, then it is the moment"
" to bleed. </p> <p> If you have a lot of stealth in hand and a wall deck "
"on the table, one option is to figure out something to do to the wall "
"player (steal %(the_rack)s, for exemple). </p> <p> If you predator has "
"high intercept, do not undertake non-directed actions unless you have a "
"lot of stealth in hand. </p> <h2>Variants</h2> <p> Including more "
"%(nocturn)s is an option, as is using some %(sudden_reversal)s to disable"
" the prey's Master bloat (%(villein)s, %(vessel)s, <em>etc.</em>). </p> "
"<p> The <strong>Fastball</strong> variant uses the %(gremlins)s + "

" combination to enable %(lutz_von_hohenzollern)s to vote <em>and</em> "
"bleed in the same turn, like in %(fabien_garcia_s_deck)s from 2014 EC "
"FCQ. </p> <p> The <strong>AD&D</strong> variant uses %(derange)s and "

"%(telepathic_misdirection)s can be used against bleeds. "
"%(delaying_tactics)s and %(poison_pill)s are used against votes. </p> <p>"
" %(kindred_spirits)s provides some bloat and %(madman_s_quill)s can be "

"There is no combat module, and a strong combat deck can become an issue. "
"It is compensated by the fact the deck is fast. </p> <h2>Tips & "

"be used to fix this. </p> <p> %(dreams_of_the_sphinx)s and "
"%(heart_of_nizchetus)s help with cards rotation and avoid jamming the "
"hand with stealth if the prey chooses not to block. </p> <p> "
"%(poison_pill)s is an interesting alternative to %(delaying_tactics)s in "
"a weenie deck: it does not cost a blood, which is better as blood is a "
"rare resource in this deck, plus it is an excellent counter to high "
"damage anti-weenie votes like %(anarchist_uprising)s, "
"%(ancilla_empowerment)s and %(domain_challenge)s. </p> <p> Only one copy "
"of each vampire in the crypt makes sure that each draw on the crypt will "
"get a vampire that can be brought into play. </p> <h2>Variants</h2> <p> "
"There are many small variations of this archetype. %(restructure)s "
"(against ally), %(enchanted_marionette)s and %(telepathic_counter)s "
"(because %(narrow_minds)s can cripple %(telepathic_misdirection)s) are "
"sometimes included. More %(wash)s and %(sudden_reversal)s can be "
"included, sometimes even %(bleeding_the_vine)s, to counter Master bloat "
"cards like %(villein)s and improve the deck forward pressure. </p> <p> "
"Bigger capacity vampires can be used like in %(norbert_broda_s_deck)s "
"from 2015. A stable access to %(OBF)s and %(AUS)sgives them better "
"stealth and let them use %(the_call)s and %(no_trace)s for combat "
"defence, although the deck gets a bit slower. </p> <p> Lower capacity "
"vampires can be used, dropping %(obf)s entirely to rely exclusively on "
"%(DEM)s, as in %(bram_van_stappen_s_deck)s from the 2013 German NC. This "
"is an even faster variation, but more fragile as the stealth gets lower "
"and the vampires have more chances to get blocked. </p> <p> Finally, a "
"more stable crypt can be used, like in %(pawel_kosz_s)s deck from 2011, "
"but %(wider_view)s is included to help with crypt rotation in this case. "

"<h3>1. Theme</h3> <p> The first step to build a deck is to choose a "
"theme, a core principle to build upon. Multiple possibilities here: <ul> "
"<li><strong>Clan</strong>: the most common theme, just choose a "
"clan.</li> <li><strong>Discipline(s)</strong>: choose one or more "
"disciplines you want to play.</li> <li><strong>Star</strong>: choose a "
"star vampire with powerful disciplines or abilities.</li> "
"<li><strong>Cards combination</strong>: choose a combination of two to "
"four cards you want to play together.</li> </ul> </p> <h3>2. Four "
"strategic pillars</h3> <p> The second step, before adding more cards to "
"the deck, is to define the four pillars of the deck strategy: <ul> "
"<li><strong>Payload:</strong> how the deck delivers pool damage to its "
"prey. Does it %(bleed)s? Use %(politics)s? Some other pool damage device "
"like %(anarch_revolt)s or %(dragonbound)s? </li> <li> <strong>Delivery "
"system:</strong> how the deck makes sure the payload is delivered. If it "
"bleeds, does it use stealth, block denial or an overwhelming number of "
"actions? If it uses political actions, does it use stealth to get them "
"through? How does it get enough votes? If it uses specific pool damage "
"cards, do they need protection or support to apply their effect? </li> "
"<li> <strong>Defense:</strong> how the deck avoids to lose. %(Bloating)s "
"is the most generic defense: gaining pool works against all offensive "
"strategies. Most decks use a modicum of bloat, some rely on a heavy bloat"
" as their sole defense. <em>Blocking</em> is the second most generic "
"defense: most offensive strategies use actions. More focused defensive "
"tools are often used against the most widespread offensive strategies: "
"%(bounce)s or <em>Reduction</em> against bleed, %(delaying_tactics)s and "
"%(poison_pill)s against politics. </li> <li> <strong>Combat "
"Management:</strong> how the deck deals with minion combats. If it does "
"not plan to block, <em>support allies</em> to block rush actions can be "
"enough. Some decks plan to avoid combat and use %(combat_ends)s effects "
"when it cannot be avoided. Others plan to use combats to optimize "
"%(bruise)s in their favor. </li> </ul> </p> <h3>3. Cards</h3> <p> Now "
"select the crypt and library cards to put in the deck. The minions you "
"select will define the range of disciplines you can use and, "
"symmetrically, the library cards you choose and their requirements will "
"define what minions you want in your crypt. </p> <p> During this card "
"selection process, only add <strong>one copy of each card</strong> you "
"want to play. Check the %(best_cards)s and the %(deck_archive)s for "
"ideas. If you find tournament winning examples close to your deck list, "
"they may give you ideas about what to include. </p> <p> At the end you "
"should have <strong>4 to 12 crypt cards and 20 to 40 library "
"cards</strong>. If you have more, it is time to sit back and ponder what "
"is really useful and what should be cut. Consider your four strategic "
"pillars to help you decide: payload is more important than delivery, "
"itself more important than defense, and combat management comes last. "

"defensively</strong>, do not hesitate to keep vampires unlocked to be "
"able to block more often. </p> <p> <strong>Do not stack permanent "
"intercept</strong> on a single vampire: if one has the "
"%(bowl_of_convergence)s, another should get the %(raven_spy)s. The more "
"vampires are able to intercept with good score, the less efficient block "
"denials cards like %(seduction)s become. </p> <p> You can target a strong"
" vampire to put her into to torpor then <strong>diablerize</strong> her "
"with a low capacity disposable vampire of yours. </p> <p> <strong>Keep "
"them guessing</strong> about your hand, no one should know if you can or "
"cannot block an action, if you have or do not have what it takes to send "
"their vampires in torpor by combat. </p> <p> Do not let <strong>combat "
"cards jam</strong> your hand. If need be, use %(deep_song)s to enter "
"combat and play the cards instead of using it for a bleed your prey may "
"be too afraid to block. </p>"

"<h2>Summary</h2> <p> This is a Toreador Antitribu <em>Breed & Vote</em> "
"deck. The setup is to get a the oldest vampire out first, then play "

"Toreador Antitribu in play. The idea is to overwhelm other decks by sheer"

"These cards should be kept in hand: even copies to replace them are "
"useful. </p> <h2>Offence</h2> <p> <strong>Pool damage</strong> is high, "
"using %(kine_resources_contested)s and bleed actions — especially if "
"%(palla_grande)s is in play. If %(enchant_kindred)s is used at superior "
"%(PRE)s in the beginning to build up more power, it becomes an excellent "
"bleed action at inferior %(pre)s later on. </p> <p> The deck has almost "
"no stealth: it uses %(change_of_target)s against wakes and %(majesty)s at"
" superior %(PRE)s to cancel combats after an action is block, then unlock"
" and try another one. The sheer number of actions will ensure most of "
"them get through. Still, %(resist_earth_s_grasp)s is available to help "
"get critical actions through, like %(the_embrace)s. </p> <h2>Defence</h2>"
" <p> The <strong>combat module is defensive</strong>, using %(majesty)s "

"with some %(leeching)s from the vampires with %(vessel)s. "
"%(creepshow_casino)s and %(the_hungry_coyote)s help get more blood out of"
" hunt actions, and %(perfectionist)s is used to get even more blood back "
"on vampires. </p> <p> The deck avoids combat so it <strong>does not try "
"to intercept</strong> actions, hence the high bloat module. It uses only "
"%(delaying_tactics)s against critical votes and "
"%(telepathic_misdirection)s to bounce bleeds. </p> <h2>Tips</h2> <p> Play"
" <strong>as many actions as possible</strong>. As a general rule, do not "
"keep vampires unlocked and never try to intercept. </p> <p> Keep your "
"vampires <strong>out of torpor</strong>. Embraces seem expendable, but "
"the power of this deck relies on the number of minions. If an Embrace "
"goes into torpor, pay the blood and get her out. </p> <p> <strong>Keep "
"your votes</strong> for when %(foundation_exhibit)s hit the table. "
"%(consanguineous_boon)s is your best bloat device and it is critical to "

"<h2>Summary</h2> <p> This is a Lasombra <em>Stealth, Bleed & Vote</em> "
"deck. The setup is to get a the oldest vampire out first, then play "
"%(govern_the_unaligned)s at superior %(DOM)s to get more Lasombra in "
"play. Each vampire can undertake strong bleed and strong votes, and the "
"high level of stealth make them hard to block. </p> <h2>Offence</h2> <p> "
"<strong>Pool damage</strong> is very high, using "
"%(kine_resources_contested)s and %(govern_the_unaligned)s, modified by "
"%(conditioning)s. </p> <p> This strong offence is supported by a "
"<strong>strong stealth module</strong> of 20 action modifiers. "
"%(shadow_play)s, %(shroud_of_absence)s and %(shroud_of_night)s improve "
"stealth, %(tenebrous_form)s can even be used at superior %(OBT)s to deny "
"block from an ally (as they have no blood to spend). Finally, "
"%(blanket_of_night)s and %(seduction)s are excellent block denials in "
"case the prey stacks too much intercept to get the actions through. </p> "
"<p> Finally, along damage dealing votes, %(banishment)s makes for an "
"excellent vampire remover since the capacity of the deck vampires is "
"high. Played on a vampire with low blood, it forces the Methusalah to pay"
" pool again to get her back into play. </p> <h2>Defence</h2> <p> The "
"<strong>bloat module is strong</strong>, using %(villein)s to get blood "
"back from the big capacity vampires, as well as two strong bloating "
"votes: %(ancient_influence)s and %(political_stranglehold)s. </p> <p> "
"<strong>Intercept is low</strong>, with %(under_siege)s being the only "
"intercept tool (although a very good one). </p> <p> The combat module is "
"strictly defensive, with %(oubliette)s and %(shadow_body)s for <em>« "
"Strike: Combat Ends »</em> and %(obedience)s to avoid the combat "
"altogether. </p> <p> The deck should be careful about what to intercept "
"as it needs to avoid difficult combats. Wakes are available with "
"%(on_the_qui_vive)s and %(wake_with_evening_s_freshness)s, to be able to "
"play %(deflection)s while locked. </p> <h2>Tips</h2> <p> Beware that some"
" decks include %(archon_investigation)s: <strong>bleeding over 3 is a "
"risk</strong> for the vampire, only the most disposable should be risked "
"this way. </p> <p> Early game, use %(govern_the_unaligned)s at superior "
"%(DOM)s <strong>two to four times</strong>: stay modest and hidden during"
" this build-up and avoid putting too much pressure on your prey too soon."
" </p> <p> <strong>Avoid combat</strong>, try to block only if you have an"
" %(obedience)s ready. </p> <p> <strong>Do not waste stealth</strong> if "
"you are not confident you can get the action through. Better to use a "
"<em>« Strike: Combat Ends »</em> or hope the combat does not go too bad, "

"<h3>Lunge</h3> <p> The deck has great forward power, but using it well is"
