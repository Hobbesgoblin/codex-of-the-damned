<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>stealth & bleed</em> deck using the Lasombra clan, with the <i>D£</i> disciplines.
    During the beginning, it uses
    {{ card("Govern the Unaligned") }}
    to get vampires out faster and cheaper. When enough minions are into play, it switches to delivering
    strong bleed actions using <i>£</i> for stealth.
</p>
<p>
    The deck uses
    {{ card("Nocturn") }} to protect its vampires
    from agression, but also to deliver more bleed in a single turn. At some point,
    {{ card("The Unmasking") }} comes into play and makes them even
    better defenders.
</p>
<p>
    Stealth is high, with 14 stealth modifiers and
    {{ card("Elysian Fields") }} as a permanent enhancer.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Deflection") }} and
    {{ card("Delaying Tactics") }} defend against bleed and votes,
    and the deck uses no combat card at all, relying entirely on the
    {{ card("Nocturn") }} and stealth to avoid it.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    One or two {{ card("Nocturn") }} should be brought into play each turn.
    Keeping one in hand just to make sure it can be brought into play the next turn makes sense.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Pentex™ Subversion") }} can be used for the lunge
    if the prey has a strong blocker.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("On the Qui Vive") }} can also be used by a
    {{ card("Nocturn") }} so it can bleed <em>and</em> block a rush action.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Zaire River Ferry") }} is an additional stealth
    enhancer, plus it prevents rush actions: a nice combination.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    This example decklist uses an unusually high number of
    {{ card("Nocturn") }}. The <strong>Standard</strong> variant
    uses somewhere between 5 and 12 of them, and more
    {{ card("Govern the Unaligned") }} and stealth modifiers.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Sergio Gracia's deck"), twda_id="2k9fdsn") }} from 2009
    is a good example. He even uses {{ card("Anarch Convert") }}
    just to help rotate the crypt and make sure 4 different vampires get out fast.
</p>
<p>
    In a sense, the
    {{ link("/archetypes/kiasyd-stealth-bleed", _("Kiasyd Stealth & Bleed")) }} archetype can be seen as a variation of this one.
</p>
<p>
    The <strong>Black Hand</strong> variant uses groups 3 and 4 to include
    {{ card("Henri Lavenant") }} alongside
    {{ card("Ermenegildo, The Rake") }} and
    {{ card("Banjoko") }}, so it can use Black Hand cards like
    {{ card("Tattoo Signal") }},
    {{ card("Watchtower: Four Ride Forth") }},
    {{ card("Remover") }} and
    {{ card("The Admonitions") }}.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Csaba Greguss's deck"), twda_id="2k9budapesthcq") }} from 2009 is a good example.
