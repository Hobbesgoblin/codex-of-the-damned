<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>vote</em> deck using centered around the <i>Of</i> disciplines, with
    {{ card("Giotto Verducci") }} as a star.
</p>
<p>
    The base idea is to get {{ card("Kaymakli Fragment") }}
    fast using {{ card("Giotto Verducci") }}'s ability, then
    use it (the infernal version) to get some titled vampires out fast and cheap.
</p>
<p>
    Using <i>O</i> for maximum stealth, the deck then proceeds to destroy its prey with
    {{ card("Kine Resources Contested") }} and
    {{ card("Parity Shift") }}.
</p>
<p>
    The deck has no bounce against bleeds, but {{ card("Villein") }} and
    {{ card("Parity Shift") }} make for a nice bloat.
    Furthermore, the few {{ card("Second Tradition: Domain") }}
    and {{ card("Unleash Hell's Fury") }} provide a sturdy defence
    already.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    {{ card("Ashur Tablets") }} provide a bit of recursion so that
    cards discarded with {{ card("Giotto Verducci") }}'s ability
    can be fetched back.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Condemnation: Mute") }} is used to get the vote lock
    faster by silencing opponents titled vampires.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("The Textbook Damnation") }} is included so that
    another vampire with <i>f</i> can get the
    {{ card("Kaymakli Fragment") }} from
    {{ card("Giotto Verducci") }},
    use {{ card("Freak Drive") }} to unlock then use the <em>Fragment</em>
    again in the same turn.
</p>
<p>
    {{ card("Wider View") }} is included to help rotate the crypt
    and get rid of the spurious {{ card("Giotto Verducci") }} copies
    for more titled vampires.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Variants exist using different crypts, like <em>Inner Circle</em> vampires with <i>OD</i> or centered a bit more
    around the <i>OR</i> disciplines with more Ventrue in the crypt:
    {{ card("Arika") }},
    {{ card("Jaroslav Pascek") }},
    {{ card("Lucinde, Alastor") }},
    {{ card("Marcus Vitel") }} and
    {{ card("Queen Anne") }}.
    {{ link("/deck-search", _("Vincent Ripoll's Deck"), twda_id="2015encle") }} for the 2015 English NC
    is a good example.
